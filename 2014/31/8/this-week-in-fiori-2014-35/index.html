<p>Hello and welcome to another episode in This Week in Fiori (TWIF) – for week 35, the last week in August already. This week it’s an all-SAP affair. Without further ado, let’s get to it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://help.sap.com/fiori_bs2013/helpdata/en/99/e464520e2a725fe10000000a441470/content.htm">Catalog of SAP Fiori Apps</a> by SAP</strong><br>
This has recently started to appear on people’s radar, and is a nice resource for summarising all the apps available so far. There are a lot of apps listed, and according to a rough calculation it looks like 370 apps are now listed.</p>
<p>I guess one issue with this catalog page is that it doesn’t really scale, from a human readable perspective, and you don’t get a feel for where the majority of the apps lie. For that, I’d of course recommend my <a href="https://code.bluefinsolutions.com/~dadams/FioriWebinar/AppAnalysis.html">SAP Fiori App Analysis Tool</a> that I mentioned in a previous TWIF episode (<a href="/2014/08/01/this-week-in-fiori-2014-31/">TWIF 2014-31</a>). This tool lists the apps that were available at the time the tool was built (313 of them), and I need to get round to add the new apps to the database. Of course, perhaps if I found a few of the right shaped tuits I might attempt to parse the source of this Catalog page. Ideally, SAP would supply a machine readable dataset. Please?</p>
<p>Here’s my rough calculation, by the way :-)</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2014/08/cat-300x213.jpg" alt="cat"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=85&amp;locale=en_US&amp;selectedFilters=tag_0:0,tag_202:13848&amp;kw=">SAP Fiori Subtrack at SAP TechEd &amp; d-code</a> by SAP</strong><br>
The SAP TechEd conference season is starting soon and the excitement is building already. This year there’s a User Experience &amp; User Interface Development track[^n]. Within this track there’s an <a href="http://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=85&amp;locale=en_US&amp;selectedFilters=tag_0:0,tag_202:13848&amp;kw=">SAP Fiori subtrack</a>, which is great to see (although not unexpected!). Here’s a quick glance of the sessions in this subtrack in Berlin:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2014/08/fiorisubtrack.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Mini CodeJams, Code Reviews, Lectures and Hands-on Workshops. There are not as many as I’d like, but it’s a good start. Perhaps I’ll see you there?</p>
<p>[^n]:Ironically the SAP TechEd &amp;&amp; d-code site makes it very difficult for me as a user to use – following links within the Agenda Builder break fundamental browsing contracts and expectations, such as being unable to go back having selected a track or subtrack, for example. Bad UX at its best.</p>
<p>**<a href="http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-52555">Use Cases for Extending the UI of SAP Fiori Apps</a> by Clement Selvaraj<br>
**One of the better (read: more comprehensive) PDF based documents to come out over the past few months, that has only just come to my attention, is this PDF-based detailed document on extending SAP Fiori apps. It takes a specific functional scenario (<a href="http://help.sap.com/fiori_bs2013/helpdata/en/20/c74c522565d330e10000000a44538d/frameset.htm">Report Quality Issue</a>) and walks the reader through a series of extension use cases. These use cases cover the extension concepts (extension points and controller hooks), and as a nice by-product, give the reader insight into a little bit of how a real SAP Fiori app is put together under the covers. For example, it highlights the Sn views (S2.view.xml, S3.view.xml, and so on) which my colleague Brenton and I covered in our <a href="http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/July-2014/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/">Understanding SAP Fiori Webinar</a> a couple of months ago. See the accompanying video screencast “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM0ffI-GxGk">Understanding SAP Fiori</a>” for more details.</p>
<p>Well that’s it for now, thanks for reading. I hope you’re enjoying this TWIF series … do please let me know if there’s any way I can make things better, I’d love to hear from you. Until next time, share &amp; enjoy!</p>
