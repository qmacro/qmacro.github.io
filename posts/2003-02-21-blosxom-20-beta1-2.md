My favourite blogging software just got better.

Congratulations to [Rael](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/) in releasing the [plugin](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugin.shtml)-enabled [2.0 Beta1](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/downloads/blosxom_2_0_b1.tar.gz) of [Blosxom](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom). I dropped it into my cgi-bin directory, tweaked a few things, and it worked like a dream.

One of the plugins available already is [RSS 1.0 plugin](http://www.raelity.org/archives/computers/internet/weblogs/blosxom/plugins/rss10.html), which I’m now using to generate <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> 1.0 – see the [Syndication](../../../%7Edj/2003/01/weblogsyndication.shtml) page for details. This means I can stop using the old [XSLT-based mechanism](/2002/09/12/from-rss-091-to-10/). Another is the [Foreshortened plugin](http://www.raelity.org/archives/computers/internet/weblogs/blosxom/plugins/foreshortened.html) which I’m also using to have a short description generated for the <description/> tag, while the entire content of the post goes into the <content:encoded/> tag from the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym>[Content Module](http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/).

One thing that strikes me as interesting is the angle in the [plugin documentation](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/plugin.shtml) which encourages plugin developers to respect the Zen of [Blosxom](http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom) and keep its users and platforms (Linux, OS-X and MSWindows) in mind when developing. It’s a refreshing and positive call for simplicity.
