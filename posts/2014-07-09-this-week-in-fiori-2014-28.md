Already a week has passed since my [first post in this series](/2014/07/02/this-week-in-fiori-2014-27/) and the Fiori related content is increasing. A lot of that is technical, as folks get to grips with the configuration and development mechanisms that underpin Fiori. Perhaps I’ll have a technical “This Week in Fiori” (TWIF) post next time, but for now, here are some more articles, along with some observations.

**[SAP Fiori Brings Out Four Tools To Improve User Experience](http://www.mobilemarketportal.com/mobile-platform/articles/383045-sap-fiori-brings-out-four-tools-improve-user.htm) by Steve Anderson
**The thing that struck me about this article is that the [tools](http://www.news-sap.com/sap-fiori-apps-rapid-deployment/) that Steve writes about – rapid deployment solutions, proof of concept services, and design thinking – implicitly underline the fact that User Experience (UX) has really arrived in the SAP world of enterprise software. UX has stopped just being a natural by-product of application design, as it might be when dynpro-oriented applications are built with a transactional focus; it’s now an explicit and important part of the overall process.

**[SAP Fiori UX – Apps Overview with Screenshots](http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-56438) by Oliver Lehmann
**This is a link to a great PDF-based resource containing details of the current SAP Fiori applications, of which there are over 300 (313 to be precise – see the “[Webinar & More: Understanding SAP Fiori](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/July-2014/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/)” link below). With the organisation by Line of Business (LoB) category, and role, and plenty of screenshots, it’s extremely useful as a visual reference, especially if you haven’t seen may of the SAP Fiori apps in action yet.

**[SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](http://experience.sap.com/wp-content/fiori-guidelines/)
**Talking of great resources, one not to miss is this set of (beta) design guidelines for Fiori from SAP. I spent 6 months working as a member of the core UI5 team at SAP Walldorf in 2013/2014 and in my time there I really got to appreciate the tremendous passion, the effort and the attention to detail that the design and development teams have and exhibit on a daily basis. A lot of this detail, essential in making the SAP Fiori UX what it is today, has been collated and made available in a very easy to follow guidelines. As we move from “SAP Fiori” to “Fiori” and start to build our own apps, these guidelines will play an important role.

**[Webinar & More: Understanding SAP Fiori](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/July-2014/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/) by me**
 A few weeks ago, Brenton O’Callaghan and I hosted a public [Bluefin Solutions webinar “Understanding SAP Fiori”](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/About-us/News-and-Media/Events/Webinar-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/) which was very well attended and fun to do. I wrote up some details in a followup post here, which you may find interesting. In particular, I’d like to draw your attention to a couple of things: there’s the [SAP Fiori App Analysis tool](https://code.bluefinsolutions.com/~dadams/FioriWebinar/AppAnalysis.html) that I wrote (itself a Fiori style app) which helps you explore the details of the currently available SAP Fiori apps, all 313 of them; it’s accompanied by a [short explanatory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVeQ4adHgaY) too. Then there’s all the stuff that Brenton and I didn’t manage to cover, in particular a deep dive into some of the details of an SAP Fiori application’s architecture. We recorded this as a sort of “Director’s Cut” video “[Understanding SAP Fiori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM0ffI-GxGk)” as a follow on to the webinar itself.

So that’s it for this week, until next time – share & enjoy!
