A (slightly) belated congrats to [Ben](http://www.benhammersley.com/) on the publication of his book, [Content Syndication with RSS](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/consynrss/). Just in time for my Christmas list. Having [shared a similar experience](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jabber/) I can appreciate the effort he has most certainly put in. Well done Ben.
