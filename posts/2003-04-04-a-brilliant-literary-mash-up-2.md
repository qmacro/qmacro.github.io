… is a great way to describe, as [Kevin Marks did](http://epeus.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_epeus_archive.html#200088180), the fusion of Hogwarts and Molesworth by [Alice Dryden](http://www.alice.dryden.co.uk/), who describes it thus:

> Wot hapen when nigel molesworth, the curse of st custards, find himself at hoggwarts skool for WITCHCRAFT and wizzardry? [Read on!](http://www.alice.dryden.co.uk/ho_for_hoggwarts.htm)

A must-read. It brings back many happy memories for me and I’m sure tons of other people of my generation. Molesworth is the creation of Geoffrey Willians and Ronald Searle, who wrote the [Down With Skool!](http://allconsuming.net/item.cgi?isbn=1851459553) collection, as any fule kno!
