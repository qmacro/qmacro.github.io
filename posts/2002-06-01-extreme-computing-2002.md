title: Extreme Computing 2002

Great. Looks like I’ll be going to the [NTK/Mute Festival of Inappropriate Technology](http://www.xcom2002.com/). I get the feeling that it’s going to be a combination of a computer fair (with second-hand and ‘antique’ kit), conference, and general geekfest. Right up my street.
