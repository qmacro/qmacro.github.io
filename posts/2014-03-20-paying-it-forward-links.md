Today I recorded another SAP CodeTalk session with Ian Thain, this time on the topic of teaching kids computational thinking, teaching them to code: [Paying IT Forward … IT Does Compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0CvsQxI6Nw).

Here’s a quick list of links to the activities and organisations we mentioned in the talk.

[CodeClub](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/)

[CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.com/) (Our [Manchester CoderDojo](http://mcrcoderdojo.org.uk/), is hosted at the fantastic [Sharp Project](http://www.thesharpproject.co.uk/))

[Young Rewired State](http://youngrewiredstate.org)

[STEMnet](http://www.stemnet.org.uk/)

And if you need any more convincing about our computational future, you may be interested in this TEDx talk on “[Our Computational Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvOCaExeK0)“.
