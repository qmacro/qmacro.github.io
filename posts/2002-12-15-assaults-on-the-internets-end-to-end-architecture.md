Jon Udell [wrote about whitelisting and ChoiceMail](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/categories/identityPrivacy/2002/12/05.html) earlier this month, and rightly pointed out that such mechanisms were in some ways evidence that in trying to combat UCE we were losing the general efficacy of email.

I just read (via [Der Schockwellenreiter](http://www.schockwellenreiter.de/)) about another potential assault (albeit seemingly well-meant) on the same. [Wired reports](http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,56788,00.html) on a charging plan for spammers, with mechanisms that would allow genuine emails to get through.

I don’t know what the answer is. For now, I’m happy, having installed the excellent [SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org/) and enjoying virtually spam-free email bliss.
