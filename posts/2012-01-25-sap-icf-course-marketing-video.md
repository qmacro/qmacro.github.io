I dropped by [Madlab](http://madlab.org.uk/) and the [Omniversity](http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk) yesterday evening to see [Hwayoung ](http://twitter.com/hwayoung)and [Dave](http://twitter.com/davemee) and talk about the upcoming [Web Programming with the SAP Internet Communication Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1lX_X95LIaNBxlOsXxO_DFxYZfz4AxGyennxMNKIaaJE) course in early March. ([Sign up!](http://s.madlab.org.uk/sap2))

In preparation for the previous instance of the course last year, we shot a video with yours truly explaining what the course was about and why you should attend.

[Omniversity : Web Programming with SAP’s Internet Communication Framework](http://vimeo.com/27779382) from [Madlab](http://vimeo.com/madlabuk) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Madlab have their own semi-resident video expert and in the run up to the next course we’re going to shoot a new video with lots of exciting content! Well, I guess you might call it exciting if you are into SAP tech and seeing debugging activity in slow motion.

Anyway, watch this space – next week I’m over at Madlab again for the shoot. Perhaps I should get a haircut. Or a wig.
