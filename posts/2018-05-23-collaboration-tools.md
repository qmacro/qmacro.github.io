title: Collaboration tools

If you're wanting to collaborate with me, on a document or other content, please understand I'll only be able to participate if appropriate tools are used. 

There are some amazing online tools that allow online multi-user realtime editing, commenting, suggestions, revision management, and so on, and these work very well indeed.

Unfortunately, Office 365, Sharepoint and Teams are not tools that fit into this category and are detrimental to productivity and collaboration. 

Thanks.
