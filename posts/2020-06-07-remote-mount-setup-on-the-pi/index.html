Using the Pis more often, I wanted to connect them to some remote storage, specifically my old but still relevant network storage device - an Airport Time Capsule from Apple - and also be able to seamlessly read and write files on my Google Drive. This short post documents what I did, so I can refer back to it if I need to do it again. Perhaps it might be useful for you too.</p><p>Here's the relevant section from a <code>tree -L 2</code> in my home directory:</p><pre><code>.
└── mnt
    ├── gdrive
    └── timecapsule
</code></pre><h2>Mounting the Time Capsule</h2><p>This was pretty straightforward and involves adding a new line in <code>/etc/fstab</code> to represent the mount. This is the line:</p><pre><code>//timecapsule/Data /home/pi/mnt/timecapsule cifs vers=1.0,password=sekrit,rw,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
</code></pre><p>Broken down bit by bit, we have:</p><ul><li><code>//timecapsule/Data</code>: The mount device, which is the Data share on the Time Capsule itself, which is identified here as the hostname <code>timecapsule</code>. I could have used an IP address but I'm happily running a local DNS setup on this homelab (on one of the Pi Zero W devices) using <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a></li><li><code>/home/pi/mnt/timecapsule</code>: The mount point, where I want the Data share to be mounted</li><li><code>cifs</code>: The file system type; Common Internet File System (CIFS) is a dialect of the more Windows specific Server Message Block (SMB) network protocol</li><li><code>vers=1.0,password=sekrit,rw,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm</code>: There a few options specified here, such as the protocol version number, that the mount should be read-write, and so on (it seems as though the security mode 'ntlm', which was the default for a while, now must be specified explicitly)</li><li><code>0</code>: Dump (disabled), i.e. no backing up of this partition</li><li><code>0</code>: Boot time fsck (disabled), i.e. no file system check at boot time for this file system</li></ul><p>A short note on the password (which isn't actually 'sekrit', obviously) - via the airport utility on my macOS device, I connected to the Time Capsule and set up the security for the disks with a &quot;disk password&quot;, i.e. there is no user. This seemed simpler and good enough for what I need.</p><p><img src="/images/2020/06/diskconfig.png" alt="Disk configuration on the Time Capsule"></p><p>And that's it. After adding the line, a <code>mount -a</code> (as root) did the trick, and of course the mount is performed on (re)boot too.</p><h2>Mounting Google Drive</h2><p>This was a bit more involved, but still worked first time. It involves the use of <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a>, which is described as &quot;a command line program to manage files on cloud storage&quot;, and support for Google Drive is included.</p><p>Basically, I followed this excellent tutorial from Artur Klauser - <a href="https://medium.com/@artur.klauser/mounting-google-drive-on-raspberry-pi-f5002c7095c2">Mounting Google Drive on Raspberry Pi</a>, so I won't repeat all the details; instead, I'll list the commands and activities I went through here.</p><h3>Installed rclone</h3><p>I installed <code>rclone</code> from the standard repositories, and got version 1.45; in other words, I didn't bother with trying to get the latest through a <code>wget</code> pull of something newer - I think I'm happy with 1.45 (and it's worked well so far for me).</p><pre><code>sudo apt install rclone
</code></pre><h3>Set up a Google API project</h3><p>In order to use my own access configuration, I need a client ID and client secret pair for OAuth based authentication to the Google Drive API, and so I needed to get those from Google. I set up a fresh project &quot;homelab-rclone&quot;, enabled the Google Drive API, and generated some OAuth 2.0 client credentials.</p><p><img src="/images/2020/06/googleapiclient.png" alt="The OAuth 2.0 Client ID"></p><h3>Configured rclone</h3><p>After generating the credentials, I went back to the command line and fired up <code>rclone config</code>, following the guide in Artur's post mentioned earlier. Next, a simple test (<code>rclone ls --max-depth 1 gdrive:</code>) showed that I could indeed see the contents of my Google Drive. The configuration procedure caused a file <code>rclone.conf</code> to be created in <code>~/.config/rclone/</code> too, this is what the contents look like (I've elided the credential details of course):</p><pre><code>[gdrive]
type = drive
client_id = 693105092413-sv17[...].apps.googleusercontent.com
client_secret = dQwG[...]
scope = drive
token = {&quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;ya29[...]&quot;,&quot;token_type&quot;:&quot;Bearer&quot;,&quot;refresh_token&quot;:&quot;1ae03[...]&quot;,&quot;expiry&quot;:&quot;2020-06-07T16:58:38.185331858+01:00&quot;}
</code></pre><p>Note that the permissions for this config file are appropriately set to 0600 (read-write for the owner, i.e. me, only).</p><h3>Set up automatic mounting</h3><p>Using Artur's instructions, I set up a user mode service to execute <code>rclone</code>, including the use of <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/User#Automatic_start-up_of_systemd_user_instances">lingering</a>. Here, briefly, are the commands I used:</p><p>Create a new directory for this new user mode service:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/
</code></pre><p>Add the <code>[Unit]</code> and <code>[Service]</code> entries as directed in the blog post, with a little modification as some of the options to <code>rclone</code> did't work for me:</p><pre><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; ~/.config/systemd/user/rclone@.service
[Unit]
Description=rclone: Remote FUSE filesystem for cloud storage config %i
Documentation=man:rclone(1)

[Service]
Type=notify
ExecStartPre=/bin/mkdir -p %h/mnt/%i
ExecStart= \
  /usr/bin/rclone mount \
    --fast-list \
    %i: %h/mnt/%i

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
EOF
</code></pre><p>Enable &amp; start the service:</p><pre><code>systemctl --user enable rclone@gdrive
systemctl --user start rclone@gdrive
</code></pre><p>Set up lingering:</p><pre><code>loginctl enable-linger $USER
</code></pre><p>And that's it. After rebooting (to test), I can see the contents of my Google Drive at <code>~/mnt/gdrive/</code>. Success!</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/2020-06-20-removing-pavoni-steam-valve-knob/"><span>←</span> <span>Removing the knob on a La Pavoni steam valve</span> </a><a href="/posts/2020-04-05-initial-pi-configuration-via-ansible/"><span>Initial Pi configuration via Ansible</span> <span>→</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/qmacro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/djadams-qmacro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
