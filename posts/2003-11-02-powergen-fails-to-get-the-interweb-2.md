For whatever reason, our gas and electricity company is changing to [Powergen](http://www.powergen.co.uk/ "Powergen home page"). It promised the ability to manage our account online and listed useful features which I looked forward to using.

[![screenshot of useless Powergen webpage](/~dj/2003/10/small.powergen.png "Powergen fails to support my run-of-the-mill browser")](/~dj/2003/10/powergen.png "link to bigger picture")

Unfortunately, on going to the website for the first time to activate my account, I received proof that Powergen has its head in the sand (or somewhere else) when it comes to customer service.

Yes, the old classic “your browser is not supported by this website”. Aaargh. Perpetrated by many companies including my mortgage company [The Woolwich](http://www.woolwich.co.uk/ "The Woolwich homepage"), who annoyingly refuse to acknowledge me as an online customer because of my choice of browser (with the result that I can’t avail myself of some of the services I need online), this issue shouldn’t exist in this millenium.

Of course, my browser is a nice up-to-date [Galeon](http://galeon.sourceforge.net/ "Galeon home page") (an extremely normal browser for the [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) environment) and not “Netscape 1.3.5″ as Powergen seems to think. To Powergen’s slight credit, they do at least acknowledge non-MS platforms and browsers. But it’s still extremely frustrating. Good grief.

Powergen joins [others](http://usefulinc.com/edd/notes/SinBin "Edd's SinBin") in the hall of shame in this respect.
