title: Asleep in 2002
---


Was I asleep in parts of 2002? Or is my memory really as bad as people tell me it is? Of course Amazon offer consumable XML. Now that an email from Chanticleer has jogged my grey matter, I have found [this](http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/join/developer/faq.html/) which looks extremely promising. Interesting times ahead for me, although at first glance it looks as if it might be only [amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/) specific (i.e. not for data on [amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/)). Anyway, perhaps I’ll catch up with the present sometime this year…
