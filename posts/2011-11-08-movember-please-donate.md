I’m taking part in [Movember](http://uk.movember.com/), a fun and serious movement where moustaches are grown, ridicule is thrown, and hopefully people become more aware of men’s health in general, and prostate and testicular cancer in particular.

The idea is that you start clean-shaven on 1st Nov, and grown your moustache through the month, raising money along the way. I have a Movember page here:

Please visit and donate what you can – I’ll be very grateful, thank you!
