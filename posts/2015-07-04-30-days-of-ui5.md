UI5, the collective short name for both SAPUI5 and OpenUI5, is soon to reach a milestone, with the release of 1.30. There’s already [a preview release available](http://openui5.tumblr.com/post/121579731137/first-preview-of-openui5-1-30).

The UI Development Toolkit for HTML5, to give it its proper long-form [Culture-style name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series), has come a long way in the last few years. It’s a multi-faceted tookit that shows pedigree, passion and influence from many directions. From the [web dynpro inspired design roots](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#test-resources/sap/ui/commons/demokit/Dialog.html),  through the hard work and commitment from all the great designers and developers, to the exemplary responsive controls we have come to know and love in the sap.m library and beyond.

And of course there’s [the open sourcing of the toolkit](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2013/12/11/what-is-openui5-sapui5), a great move on SAP’s part, influenced not in a small way by many developers both external and internal to SAP. Many of the UI5 core team have open source in their blood, part of a new generation that is making SAP what it is today.

Where would SAP Fiori be without UI5? Nowhere. The engine behind the UX revolution that is powering today’s and tomorrow’s SAP applications (with S/4HANA) is UI5.

As Norman Cook might say, “[You’ve come a long way, baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/6h3VY15qno2SJbgH2VuEnn)“.

So as a bit of fun, and to celebrate this version 1.30 milestone, here’s a series of 30 posts, one a day, on UI5 related topics. Small posts from me and some guest authors, designed to be read during a quick coffee break. Nothing earth shattering, but hopefully things that will whet your appetite for further reading, and perhaps bring to your attention features that you might not yet have had a chance to consider.
