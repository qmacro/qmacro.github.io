[SAP TechEd](http://emea.sapteched.com) is looming large, and this year it’s in Munich. (If you’re not in Europe, then SAP are holding TechEd events in Bangalore, Tokyo, and San Diego too). I went last year (in Basel), and was both impressed – by the quality of the session and tutorial content – and disappointed – at the lack of wifi and ‘net access in general. One thing that was lacking overall last year was a sense of community;  
 everyone was there on their own, with the whole event feeling more like an exhibition or computer fair, rather than a conference. That, or everyone was avoiding me ;-)

This year, it’s going to be different. There’s a [wiki](http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/), there will be [Birds Of a Feather sessions](http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/index.cgi?MunichBOF), including a [SapAndOpenSourceBof](http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/index.cgi?SapAndOpenSourceBof) run by me and my good friend [Piers](http://www.piersharding.com/blog/). Wifi and ‘net access has even been promised too. (Although when I compare the bullet points on the [Munich](http://emea.sapteched.com) and [San Diego](http://www.sapteched.com) pages, there’s a distinct difference – no wireless at Munich?)

But the biggest change this year for me is that I’ll be speaking. I’m giving a one hour session:  
**

> ***The Internet Communication Framework: Into Context and Into  
>  Action!***

> *Business Server Pages (BSP) technology is a great way to put together  
>  ABAP powered web-based applications. But that’s not the only way; in  
>  the grander scheme of things, BSP technology is ‘just’ a layer that  
>  sits on top of the Internet Communication Framework (ICF), the Web  
>  Application Server’s core foundation that provides a full set of  
>  object-orientated APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses.  
>  This talk will put the ICF not only into context – what it is, how  
>  it works, why it’s important – but also into action, with a live  
>  demonstration where we build, debug and run a simple web-based service.  
>  If you’re interested in looking under the hood at the engine that  
>  connects the Internet Communication Manager with the ABAP Personality  
>  world, and learning how to use it yourself, then this talk is for you! *

**

I’m really excited at the chance to ramble and rant about some great parts of the Web Application Server; in many ways, the ICF is a bridge between the traditional walled world of SAP and the world of open standards. And this particular bridge is constructed with blocks that have ‘HTTP’ stamped through them.
