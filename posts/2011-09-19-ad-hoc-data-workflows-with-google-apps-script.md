At [tonight’s Manchester Google Technology User Group’s meetup](http://madlab.org.uk/content/manchester-google-technology-user-group-12/) at Madlab, I gave a talk on building ad-hoc data workflows with [Google Apps Script](http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/).

The Google Apps application set, combined with the universally accessible and always-on nature of Google Apps Script, with its access to a ridiculously large set of useful APIs (in the form of [Services](http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/guide.html)), makes an ideal platform for rich collaborative data workflow solutions that can be quickly prototyped, and built into robust, reliable and incredibly useful mashups for you and your users.

I’ve become a big fan of the technology, the platform and the approach, and Google are introducing more features all the time – just this week access to [API services](http://code.google.com/googleapps/appsscript/googleapisservices.html) have been introduced, starting with BigQuery, Prediction, UrlShortener and Tasks APIs.
