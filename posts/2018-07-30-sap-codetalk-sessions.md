title: SAP CodeTalk sessions
---

My friend and colleague [Ian Thain](https://people.sap.com/ian.thain) organises and hosts the excellent [SAP CodeTalk](https://www.sap.com/uk/developer/resources.html) series, that's been going for over five years now, with more than 240 episodes. Nice work, Ian!

I've been very honoured to be a guest on SAP CodeTalk a few times, and I thought it would be worth listing those sessions here.
