I’ve been baking bread now for quite a while now. The bread baking bug first got ahold of me when visiting friends. They had a bread making machine – something that you put all the basic ingredients into, hit a button, and presto. Naturally we bought one soon after, and I was, well, "hooked".

But sometime last year I decided there was too much plastic and electronics between me and the bread, and started making it by hand. Just the ingredients, a bowl, time, [Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/), and me. What a difference. It’s become my number one way to relax – especially after a session at the keyboard. I love making bread. All sorts. And I also love not going to to the bakers to buy bread. It’s a nano-step [closer](/2003/01/20/a-new-year-and-a-new-approach/) to self-sufficiency. And a very rewarding one.

So this Christmas I progressed backwards even more. I received a fantastic present – a [grain mill](/~dj/2004/01/GrainMill.jpg) – Hawo’s [Queen 1](http://www.hawos.de/pages/engl/muhl8a.htm) model. Beautifully simple and rock solid. The millstones are corundum, 10cm in diameter.

As well as giving you the [total health benefit](http://www.hawos.de/engl/alles2.htm) that only freshly milled wheat (and other grain) can, milling your own on a loaf-by-loaf basis is fun, and gives me my daily fix for the simpler things in life. I guess the next step is to grow my own. I’m just not sure I have the [space](/~dj/2003/09/vegplot.jpg)!
