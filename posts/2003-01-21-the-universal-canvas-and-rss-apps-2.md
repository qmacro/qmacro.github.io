It seems that beyond carrying syndication information, <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> is a very useful and flexible way to get all sorts of application data pushed to a user over time. In the same way that a web browser is a [universal canvas](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ucapi-discuss/) upon which limitless services and information can be painted, so (in an albeit much smaller way) an RSS reader/aggregator might also find its place as an inbox for time-related delivery of all sorts of information. This is borne out by the [experimental “booktalk” application](/undefined/) which uses the <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> infrastructure to deliver information that appears over time.

Application data and <acronym title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</acronym> is something that [Matthew Langham](http://radio.weblogs.com/0103021/) touched upon [last December](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/12476). And of course, this isn’t just hot air, [we’re already generating RSS](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/12476) out of SAP R/3 at work for a sales (SD) application.
