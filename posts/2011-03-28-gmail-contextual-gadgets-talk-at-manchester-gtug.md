I gave a talk at the [Manchester Google Technology User Group](http://www.gtugs.org/chapter.jsp?id=1023) March [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/mangtug/events/16557449/) on [Gmail Contextual Gadgets](/2010/06/21/getting-started-with-gmail-contextual-gadgets/). Partly so I can keep track of what slides I’ve used where, and partly to share them with a wider audience, here they are.
