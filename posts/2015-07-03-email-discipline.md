title: Email Discipline
---


If you’re wondering why I don’t reply to your email straight away, it’s because I try to discipline myself to email tasks generally twice a day. Once in the morning, and once again around lunchtime or in the early evening. This discipline is related to my attempts to be more focused upon, and more effective at the work I have to do. For background information, see my post [The Maker’s Schedule, Restraint and Flow](/2015/03/15/the-makers-schedule-restraint-and-flow/) and in particular the video from Scott Hanselman to which it refers.

If you need to get hold of me urgently (i.e. within hours), then give me a call. But be warned, I may not be able to answer immediately if I’m on a Pomodoro. Thanks!
