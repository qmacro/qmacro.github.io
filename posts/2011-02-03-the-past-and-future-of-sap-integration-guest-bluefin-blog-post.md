I was honoured to be invited to write the first guest blog post on [Bluefin](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/)‘s website. To start the ball rolling, I decided to take a whirlwind history tour of data and function integration with SAP’s enterprise systems, ending up a few clicks into the future with SAP’s [Project Gateway](http://en.sap.info/gateway-apps-mobile-rest-duet-enterprise/43463/2), which promises to bring a great deal of openness to SAP data. With terms such as Atom, Atom Publishing Protocol and resource orientation appearing in descriptions of what Gateway is to bring, it certainly has my attention!

Here’s the post: “[Project Gateway. A call to arms. Or at least to data.](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/insights/guest_blog/project_gateway_a_call_to_arms_or_at_least_to_data/)“
