At [SAP TechEd in Madrid](http://www.sapteched.com/emea) this year, I had the privilege of interviewing SAP’s Head of Technology & Innovation Platform (TIP) Marketing,﻿ [Aiaz Kazi](http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/251736460), on the [SAP TechEd Live](http://www.sapteched.com/online) TV channel. The interview is available [here](http://www.sapvirtualevents.com/teched/sessiondetails.aspx?sId=841).

His team has an enormous scope, covering Mobile, In-Memory, On-Demand, HANA and more. While the word “Marketing” might be auto-filtered by a techie’s radar-filter, what became clear very quickly is that this group is totally developer focused. His group is already building a brand-new Developer Center ([I wrote about this earlier this week](/2011/11/08/sap-developer-center/)) and is focused on helping the developer help themselves. What’s more, the group is staffed with developers. I’ve not managed to find anyone in TIP yet that doesn’t have a developer background.

Hasso is reported to have said “developers are the key to success”, and of course, we all know that [Developers Are The New Kingmakers](http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=%22developers+are+the+new+kingmakers%22). What becomes clear in this interview, is that there’s a re-focus on the developer in the space that spans the distance between mobile and enterprise. This re-focus is long overdue in our industry, so I applaud SAP for having the courage to lead on this. Yes, SAP will benefit because one of the keys to a successful mobile platform is a host of developers in the non traditional-SAP space. But if the message and focus builds, the developer at large will benefit even more.

Perhaps this is a milestone along the way to the upcoming Developer Renaissance?
