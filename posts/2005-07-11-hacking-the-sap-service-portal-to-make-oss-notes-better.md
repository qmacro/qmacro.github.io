Using OSS notes on SAP’s service portal is extremely cumbersome. I used [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org) to hack the UI to make it a little better. I had written it up on my [SDN blog](http://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/u/3294):

[Hacking the SAP service portal to make OSS notes better](http://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/1669)

but forgot to mention it here. [Piers](http://www.piersharding.com) had just complained to me that he couldn’t find any reference to it here, hence this post.

For the impatient, there’s the [screencast](http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/screencast.html), and the [ossnotefix.user.js](http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/ossnotefix.user.js) script.
