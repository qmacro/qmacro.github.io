I’m looking forward to a packed set of days next week in Barcelona, where [SAP TechEd EMEA 2015](events.sap.com/teched-2015-emea/en/home) is taking place. It’s packed in many ways: so much to share, so much to learn, so many people to meet and re-meet, so many kilometres to walk in the convention centre, and so much coffee.

I’m involved in a number of activities during the event. I’m co-presenting a number of hands-on sessions relating to SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) and the SAP Web IDE, Fiori, and of course the fantastic UI5 toolkit. Here’s a quick summary (in my own words):

[**UX260 Experience SAP Fiori on SAP HANA Cloud Platform**](https://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=112&sid=26128&locale=en_US)  
 SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) is changing the Fiori landscape in so many ways, by offering features and services all the way from development, through connectivity & deployment, to exposure to end users. This session gives you hands-on experience at the places where Fiori and HCP meet.

[**UX261 Extend a Fiori App with SAP Web IDE based on beautiful Fiori Reference Apps**](https://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=112&sid=26248&locale=en_US)  
 The key to the present and future success of Fiori in your organisation is the correct adoption of best practices, both from a general development perspective and also from an extension perspective (for standard SAP delivered Fiori apps). There’s a lot to get wrong, but a ton of help for you to get it right. This session shows you what and how.

[**UX262 Building SAPUI5 Applications using SAP Web IDE**](https://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=112&sid=25640&locale=en_US)  
 The SAP Web IDE is the cloud-based IDE that can. From a standing start not too long ago, it’s progressed into an impressive set of features, not least those involving the templating and plugin system. This (4hr) hands-on session, which is being given twice next week, covers these subjects and more in particular the rather exciting Runtime Adaptation (RTA) features of UI5. Oh yes!

In addition to these hands-on sessions, I’m taking part in a couple of [SAP TechEd Live Studio](http://events.sap.com/teched/en/live) events – I’m interviewing one of my heroes on SAP Development Tools (and in particular those available on HCP), and taking part in a live panel discussion on developer engagement. Stay tuned!
