As I [mentioned earlier this year](/2012/01/25/sap-icf-course-marketing-video/), we were going to create a new video for my course “[Web Programming with SAP’s Internet Communication Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1lX_X95LIaNBxlOsXxO_DFxYZfz4AxGyennxMNKIaaJE)” at the [Omniversity](http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk) of Manchester at [Madlab](http://madlab.org.uk). And we did! Boy, was it fun. [Maria](http://vimeo.com/prohyena), Madlab’s semi-resident video expert injected her creative genius into the shoot and I must say, apart from the dorky looking person in the main shot, the new video is an absolute triumph. Brilliant overtones and influence from *2001: A Space Odyssey*, too. Here’s the video:

If you’re interested in attending the next instance of the course, which is in May this year, please [sign up](http://s.madlab.org.uk/sap3/)!
