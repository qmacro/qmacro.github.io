title: Cross pollination and blossoming of scripts
---


There seems to be a wonderful, um, blossoming of scripts, tools, and ideas arould [Rael](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/)‘s [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blosxom) and the new [Blagg](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blagg) mechanisms. How about [a Blogger API interface for Blosxom](http://kavery.ecs.fullerton.edu/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/blosxmlrpc), or [a plug-in architecture for Blagg](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blagg/#blaggplugs), to name but two, in addition to the tiny hacks such as the Google search list and the bookmark ‘to read’ list, both on the right…

I’m sure it’s because Blosxom’s scent of simplicity has people doing what *they* want, with code, because there’s only the slightest whiff of required compliance, to fit in with how Blosxom works, and that’s something that all platforms, languages, and minds share: files.
