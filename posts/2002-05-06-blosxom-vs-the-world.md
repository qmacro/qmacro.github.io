title: Blosxom vs the world
---


In case you’re wondering why I’m using [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blosxom) instead of other fine weblogging tools like [Radio Userland](http://radio.userland.com/), [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/), or [Moveable Type](http://www.moveabletype.org/), I’ll tell you. Not because I don’t want to pay the minimal (or non-existent) price; not because I think that one is better than the other, not even because I refuse free hosting for my weblog…

It’s simply *because I can*.
