<p><em>Use the shell parameter expansion form <code>:+</code> for expanding optional values</em></p>
<p>I've been increasing my Bash scripting activities recently, not least in relation to some <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-messaging-handsonsapdev">live stream episodes relating to Enterprise Messaging</a> and have used some of the shell parameter expansion facilities described in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html">section 3.5.3 Shell Parameter Expansion</a> of the GNU Bash manual. In particular, I've been using what I call the &quot;default value&quot; (<code>:-</code>) form:</p>
<pre><code>${parameter:-word}
</code></pre>
<p>This form has this description: &quot;If <em>parameter</em> is unset or null, the expansion of <em>word</em> is substituted. Otherwise, the value of <em>parameter</em> is substituted&quot; and is very useful for setting default value for parameters that are expected at invocation time, for example.</p>
<p>On a walk yesterday I was listening to an episode of a series of podcasts I'd discovered that very day, on <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/">Hacker Public Radio</a>. It's an <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/series.php?id=42">in-depth series on Bash scripting</a>, and has quite a few episodes, some very recent, and the early ones dating back to 2010. The episode I listened to was <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=1648">hpr1648 :: Bash parameter manipulation</a> by <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents.php?hostid=225">Dave Morriss</a>, and I enjoyed it very much.</p>
<p>One of the things Dave mentioned was this form of expansion (<code>:+</code>), related to the one above, but sort of the opposite:</p>
<pre><code>${parameter:+word}
</code></pre>
<p>The form has this description: &quot;If <em>parameter</em> is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of <em>word</em> is substituted.&quot; Dave found this slightly odd, and commented that he couldn't quite think of a use case for this form. I couldn't, either.</p>
<p>Later that same day, I came across a live streamer on Twitch - Rob, aka <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob">rwxrob</a> - who has some excellent content, also on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rwxrob">YouTube</a>. Watching the beginning of one of his live stream recordings, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGCw6wXv1Ao">Google Shell Scripting Guide, Yes, Yes, 1000 Times Yes!</a>, he introduces a Bash shell scripting resource from Google - the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html">Shell Style Guide</a>, which he goes through in detail in the live stream.</p>
<p>Noting how great that style guide looked, I start to read through it immediately. And what do I see, in the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#quoting">section on Quoting</a>? An example of the <code>:+</code> shell expansion form (in an illustration of something else entirely), which made complete sense and explained its real purpose! I couldn't believe it - discovering multiple complementary sources of information on Bash shell scripting on the same day? Goodness me.</p>
<p>Here's the example of that <code>:+</code> shell expansion form taken directly from <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html#quoting">that section</a> in the style guide:</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> send-email --to <span class="token string">"<span class="token variable">${reviewers}</span>"</span> <span class="token variable">${ccs<span class="token operator">:+</span>"--cc" "${ccs}</span>"<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>Look at that beautiful thing!</p>
<pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token variable">${ccs<span class="token operator">:+</span>"--cc" "${ccs}</span>"<span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>If there is a value in the <code>ccs</code> variable, use it, but in the expanded context of it being a value to the <code>--cc</code> switch used with the <code>git</code> command. The value (most likely one or more email addresses) would be of no use on its own, but put with <code>--cc</code> it makes complete sense. And the icing on the cake is that the <code>:+</code> form substitutes nothing if the variable is null or unset, meaning there's no carbon-copying requested if there are no emails listed in the <code>ccs</code> variable.</p>
<p>Now that made my day. I was originally with Dave on not being able to think of a reason for the <code>:+</code> form, and then whammo, there's a perfect example right there. Thanks Dave, thanks Rob, and thanks to the Googlers who wrote the style guide!</p>
