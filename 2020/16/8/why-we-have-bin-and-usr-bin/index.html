      <h1>Why we have /bin/ and /usr/bin/</h1>

<p><em>There's a simple, historic reason why we have /bin/ and /usr/bin/</em></p>
<p>I'd half wondered for a while why many of the directories in the root filesystem (<code>/</code>) of a Linux installation are also to be found in <code>/usr</code>. Recent convention implies that 'usr' stands for &quot;User System Resources&quot; but this is really only a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym">backronym</a>.</p>
<p>There are executable files and libraries in <code>/bin/</code> and <code>/lib/</code>, for example, but also in <code>/usr/bin/</code> and <code>/usr/lib/</code>. Why? Regardless of what people might tell you today, the answer lies in the history of Unix (upon which Linux is based, of course). Created in the late 1960s / early 1970s on Digital PDP machines with limited disk space, the original Unix operating system binaries were placed on the root filesystem (mounted at <code>/</code>), with e.g. executables, libraries and configuration files split across <code>/bin/</code>, <code>/lib/</code> and <code>/etc/</code> directories respectively.</p>
<p>Separate from the root filesystem was another filesystem (on a separate disk) for users' home directories. This was <code>/usr/</code> - yes, short for &quot;user(s)&quot;.</p>
<p>As the Unix system grew, the space on the root filesystem disk eventually ran out, and a decision was made to move some of the executable and library content over to the other disk that was mounted on <code>/usr/</code>. It made sense to replicate the names of the directories on that other disk, names which therefore became <code>/usr/bin/</code> and <code>/usr/lib/</code> because of the relation to where that filesystem was mounted.</p>
<p>Over time the place for the users' home directories moved from <code>/usr/</code> to <code>/home/</code>, meaning <code>/usr/</code> content eventually lost any semblance of user-specific focus.</p>
<p>A bonus, related thing I learned fairly recently is that the &quot;s&quot; in <code>sbin</code> (which also can be found in both the filesystems mounted on root (<code>/</code>) and <code>/usr/</code>) stands for &quot;system&quot; denoting that the content is only executable by the root user.</p>
