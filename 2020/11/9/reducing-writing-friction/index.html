      <h1>Reducing writing friction</h1>

<time datetime="2020-09-11">11 Sep 2020</time>

<p><em>I've created a simple script for myself to reduce writing friction.</em></p>
<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1304117739083059200">a tweet from Simon Willison</a> earlier this week pointing to Matt Webb's <a href="http://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak">15 rules for blogging, and my current streak</a>. I decided that I would also like to try to write more, and one of the things getting in my way was the slight friction in starting a new post. I use GitHub Pages and Jekyll behind the scenes, and my posts are in Markdown, one file per post (I like the simplicity of this, it reminds me of Rael Dornfest's <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aqmacro.org+blosxom">Blosxom</a>).</p>
<p>So running the risk of being accused of a small amount of yak shaving, I wrote a very basic script (with Simon's &quot;perfect is the enemy of shipped&quot; in my head) that I could use to start a new post quickly and <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/commit/e609d80ed4c768a5236e976bce9b69a18fd01b04">pushed it to my dotfiles repo</a>.</p>
<p>The script is <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/newpost">newpost</a> and is very basic, having taken me less than 10 mins to write.<br>
That's sort of the point. I may refine it as I go on, in fact I probably will; not least because the function that generates a filename from a post title is very basic indeed, but also because I would like to perhaps create a new tmux session for editing and running Jekyll locally for test rendering. But it's good enough for now, and in fact I kicked off this post using it, by typing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; newpost reducing writing friction
</code></pre>
<p>whereupon I landed in Vim with this in the file, all ready:</p>
<pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Reducing writing friction
---
</code></pre>
<p>That'll do for now!</p>
<p>Incidentally, I'm already on a small path to writing more, having adopted Simon's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/">Today I Learned</a> (TIL) mini-post approach. I've written a few TIL posts on this blog recently and I feel very freed by the constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-08</strong> I've moved these posts to a new blog <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/">autodidactics</a> - see <a href="https://qmacro.org/2020/10/03/a-new-learning-source-for-shell-scripting/">A new learning source for shell scripting</a> for the background.</p>
