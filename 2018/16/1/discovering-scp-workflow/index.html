<p>The SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service is a key component in the next generation of enterprise solutions - allowing us to coordinate processes and activities across cloud and on-premise systems. It's a relatively young service, and I thought it would be worth digging into it a little bit to learn more.</p>
<p>I've written a series of blog posts in <a href="https://people.sap.com/dj.adams">my space on the SAP Community</a>; here's a quick list of them for reference. While they're hopefully digestible individually, they sort of follow a logical sequence, so if you have the time and inclination, you might want to read them in order.</p>
