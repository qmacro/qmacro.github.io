      <h1>Becoming an SAP Mentor Alumnus</h1>

<time datetime="2018-03-21">21 Mar 2018</time>

<p>It was in 2009 that I was honoured to be recognised as an SAP Mentor for my contributions to the SAP community at large, co-creating the original SAP Developer Network back in 2003 (which, via the SAP Community Network, is now the <a href="https://www.sap.com/community.html">SAP Community</a>). Since then I've tried to act as an SAP Mentor should act; there aren't any written rules of course, it's just something that one should know.</p>
<p>In the years since becoming an <a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/community/about/mentors-program.html">SAP Mentor</a> lots of things have happened, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that have presented themselves to me ... as well as the Mentor shirts that take up a decent space in my wardrobe and that I proudly wear at events inside and outside the SAP developer ecosphere.</p>

<p>There's an end to pretty much everything though, and I've been planning to retire to SAP Mentor Alumnus status for a while. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is to make way for new blood. I can and will continue to be active in the community - becoming an SAP Mentor Alumnus doesn't mean that changes.</p>
<p>My move to SAP Mentor Alumnus status also coincides with a couple of other events; of course, there's my recent move to <a href="/2018/01/17/coming-home/">join the SAP family</a>, but there's also the end of the term of membership of the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2016/03/08/introducing-the-new-sap-mentors-advisory-board-2016-2018/">SAP Mentors Advisory Board</a> (MAB). So I think the timing is right.</p>
<p>Thank you to my fellow SAP Mentors and the programme team, and also to my esteemed co-members of the MAB. I don't see this as a big change - I'm just moving from one group of folks I respect to another.</p>
