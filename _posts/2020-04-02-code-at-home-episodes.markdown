_This post summarises the episodes streamed live (and available as recordings) on YouTube. Find out more about the Code at Home initiative in the main blog post: [Let's learn to "Code at Home"](/2020/03/24/code-at-home/)._

All the episodes are live streamed [on my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/djadams-qmacro) and are then available on that same channel after the streams finish, as recordings. In this post are links to those recordings with a short description of each. You can easily spot the upcoming live streams and recordings as they always have the "Code at Home" background in the thumbnail, like this:

    </td>
    <td>
      <p>In this first episode we set up the tools that we need - the <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> and the <a href="https://repl.it">repl.it</a> websites. We also solve together the very first problem described on Project Euler: <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">Multiples of 3 and 5</a>.</p>

    </td>
    <td>
      <p>We start off by looking at the little "homework" challenge from last time, with a program to generate the output of a Fizz-Buzz game. Then the main part of this episode sees us take a first look at the Fibonacci sequence, what it is and how to work out the termns in that sequence, coding together a simple program to do that.</p>

    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Following on from the previous episode we take another look together at what we wrote already to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and rewrite it to make it better, using a generator function and even creating a function that produces other functions. With that, we go and solve Project Euler problem 2: <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">Even Fibonacci numbers</a>.</p>

    </td>
    <td>
      <p>Taking a break from numbers, we start to look at sentences and words, and how to parse them to grab basic data. In doing this we learn about arrays, and how to create and use them, even discovering functions and properties that are available on them. We also start to introduce the 'const' and 'let' keywords, and end with a gentle introduction to the super 'map' function.</p>
