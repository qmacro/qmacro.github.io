_This post summarises the episodes streamed live (and available as recordings) on YouTube. Find out more about the Code at Home initiative in the main blog post: [Let's learn to "Code at Home"](/2020/03/24/code-at-home/)._

All the episodes are live streamed [on my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/djadams-qmacro) and are then available on that same channel after the streams finish, as recordings. In this post are links to those recordings with a short description of each. You can easily spot the upcoming live streams and recordings as they always have the "Code at Home" background in the thumbnail, like this:

# Episodes

Here are the recordings of the live stream episodes so far. Click on the episode title link to get to the recording on YouTube.

| Episode | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ep.1  [Setting up for our first challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7gtbWiHTBY) | In this first episode we set up the tools that we need - the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and the [REPL.IT](https://repl.it) websites. We also solve together the very first problem described on Project Euler: [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).|
| Ep.2 [Fizz-Buzz and Fibonacci](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfGQ-K7dvfg) | The main part of this episode sees us take a first look at the Fibonacci sequence, what it is and how to work out the termns in that sequence, coding together a simple program to do that. I set a little "homework" challenge to write a program to generate the output of a Fizz-Buzz game too. |
| Ep. 3 [Solving a Fibonacci related challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYt7SsGbhu4) | Following on from the previous episode we take another look together at what we wrote already to generate the Fibonacci sequence, and rewrite it to make it better, using a generator function and even creating a function that produces other functions. With that, we go and solve Project Euler problem 2: [Even Fibonacci numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) |
