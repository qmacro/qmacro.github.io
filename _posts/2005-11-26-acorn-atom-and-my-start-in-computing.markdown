</div>I wrote a little piece for the [O’Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com) on [how I got into computers](http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/11/burn-in-7-dj-adams.html). It brought back lots of memories, a strong one of which was the hours, days, weeks I spent on my [Acorn Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Atom). I have my original Atom in storage, so I turned to [MESS](http://www.mess.org) for help in getting an emulated Atom booted up. Ahhh, even now the font and cursor size are whisking me back in time …
