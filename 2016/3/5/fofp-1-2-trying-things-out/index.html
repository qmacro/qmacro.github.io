<p>Part of the <a href="/2016/05/03/fofp">Fundamentals of Functional Programming</a> document.</p>
<p>Prev: <a href="/2016/05/03/fofp-1-1-introduction">FOFP 1.1 Introduction</a></p>
<p>To start exploring some of the fundamental concepts of functional programming, you don't need anything more than you've probably already got. Of course, there are &quot;more&quot; functional languages such as Haskell, Standard ML, and various dialects of Lisp, such as Scheme, Common Lisp and Clojure. But there's a language that's pretty ubiquitous and that has some very good support for core functional programming concepts.</p>
<h2 id="javascript-in-chrome" tabindex="-1">JavaScript in Chrome <a class="direct-link" href="#javascript-in-chrome" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>That language is JavaScript, and it's everywhere because it's available in all the major browsers. It's likely that you have a browser on your PC or laptop, so let's see how you can get started immediately with a simple interactive environment in which we can experiment. We'll choose the Chrome browser, not because it's fast or standards compliant, or even because it's from Google, but because it has a super set of developer tools that is worth getting to know.</p>
<p>One of those developer tools is the console - where you can enter JavaScript and have it executed immediately. This concept of a feedback loop made out of an interactive prompt with immediate execution is commonly known as a REPL, which stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop: It reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result of the evaluation and then loops around to read your next input.</p>
<h2 id="getting-ready-to-explore" tabindex="-1">Getting ready to explore <a class="direct-link" href="#getting-ready-to-explore" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Open up Google Chrome, and in a new tab, open up the Developer Tools using either the menu as shown, or using Ctrl-Shift-I (or Cmd-Shift-I on a Mac), or F12.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2016/05/developertools.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You'll see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2016/05/elements.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The developer tools have opened up next to the tab you're on. Choose the &quot;Console&quot; entry in the menu at the top, to switch to the console, or REPL. You may see some error messages relating to the tab that's open (even a simple &quot;new&quot; tab), but you can ignore them[^2]. You might also want to detach the developer tools using the &quot;Dock side&quot; option (press the three vertical dots to get this menu) - choose the double-pane icon &quot;undock into separate window&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2016/05/menu.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At this stage, you're ready to explore.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="/2016/05/03/fofp-1-3-some-basic-list-processing">FOFP 1.3 Some basic list processing</a></p>
<p>[^2]: You can clear the console, and therefore remove the errors, with Ctrl-L (or Cmd-L on a Mac).</p>
