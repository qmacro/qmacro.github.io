      <h1>&quot;fiux2&quot; Week 7 - Build Your Own SAP Fiori App</h1>

<time datetime="2016-04-10">10 Apr 2016</time>

<p>(See first post in this series — <a href="/2016/03/04/fiux2-the-opensap-fiori-course-2016-edition/">“fiux2″ – The openSAP Fiori Course – 2016 Edition</a> — for links to the other posts).</p>
<p>We’re into week 7, the final week of this openSAP course “Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud – 2016 Edition”. As we’re in the midst of building our app for the Develop Challenge, this final week is deliberately short, with only two units.</p>
<p><strong>Unit 1 “End-to-End Development Scenario”.</strong> If you’ve seen a demo of the SAP Web IDE before, in particular for generating and subsequently editing an app from a template, you’ll be already familiar with a lot of the content of this unit. I’m all for repeating information and demos for learning and for strengthening the neurons, but I honestly didn’t find anything significantly new here. I think perhaps the intention is to show a final end-to-end scenario, where each course participant should now be comfortable with the details and nuances for each part along the way.</p>
<p>There was one part which touched on some of the features of the git functionality in the Web IDE, along with a brief view of how that then is exposed in the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, but I’d like to have seen this in the context of a non-master branch.</p>
<p><strong>Unit 2 “End-to-End Administration Scenario”.</strong> In many ways, this is the other side of the coin to the development of UI5-powered apps for Fiori scenarios. While Unit 1 covers this development, this unit briefly covers what’s possible in the context of the setting for these apps – the SAP Fiori Launchpad. Specifically, this is for the cloud-based Launchpad, as provided by the SAP HANA Cloud Portal services of the HANA Cloud Platform .</p>
<p>It’s a shame that the content of this unit is out of date, at least visually.</p>

<p>The SAP Fiori configuration cockpit changed a while ago, and looks nothing like what’s shown in this unit. There was a brief disclaimer message during the video, but that doesn’t really help that much. That said, the actual functionality has not changed much, and with the availability of the cloud-based Launchpad in the HCP trial accounts, it’s quite easy for you to explore it yourself.</p>
<p>In fact, because there are some complex relationships possible between the building blocks such as tiles, groups, catalogues and role, it’s better anyway to have a play around and try to get something working that makes sense to you. This is a great example of where theory is not everything – getting the mechanisms under your fingernails and the ideas embedded into your understanding is key here.</p>
<p>One feature that was highlighted was the “dynamic” tile type. This is close to my heart, especially in the light of our upcoming lunchtime webinar on 26 Apr:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/events/the-sap-fiori-launchpad-as-a-human-centric-dashboa">The SAP Fiori Launchpad as a Human-Centric Dashboard</a></p>
<p>where we explore the possibilities that are presented to us by the SAP Fiori Launchpad and its features such as the different tile types.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a nice touch after the instructor added the details for the dynamic tile – specifically the Number Unit value “Notebooks”:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-10-at-14.23.34.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>“Wait!” I hear you say. “That’s static text – what about consuming this in different languages?”.</p>
<p>And the openSAP course folks must have pre-empted that thought. Directly following this was a short section on the Translations service within the configuration cockpit. In a similar way to how you handle internationalisation (i18n) resources for a Fiori app using the UI5 detection and resourcing mechanisms, so you also can manage property files of name/value pairs for text elements.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot of what this looks like, slightly beyond where this unit’s video ended:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-10-at-14.25.15.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Here, I’ve added and activated a German locale for my Launchpad, which means I’d see the translated texts when consuming the Launchpad site in German, say, by adding the sap-language=de parameter in the URL.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I mentioned earlier – the best way for you to learn more is to get going on your trial account and play around. Have fun!</p>
