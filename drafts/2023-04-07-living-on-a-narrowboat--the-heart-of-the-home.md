In [Living on a narrowboat - embracing constraints](/blog/posts/2023/01/16/living-on-a-narrowboat-embracing-constraints/) I briefly mentioned the stove I'm getting. This post is about choosing a stove in general, and how I came to my decision and the factors I considered.

Some modern boats rely on just a radiator circuit. Some even have underfloor heating. Some have an electric heater and fan combination that pushes warm air into the cabin (a little bit like in a car). And of course some (I would suggest the majority) have a standalone stove of some sort. 

## The stove on Queenie

I spent some time on a narrowboat called Queenie that I rented from [Star Narrowboat Holidays](https://www.starnarrowboatholidays.co.uk/) (you can see a picture of her moored up in [the first post in this series](/blog/posts/2023/01/02/i'm-moving-onto-a-narrowboat/)) and Queenie had an electric heater and fan mechanism, plus a small multifuel stove. I didn't use the former as it was noisy and not that effective, so I relied solely on the stove. One trip was in February, when the temperatures in the UK are still fairly low (often around freezing) so it was a good test. 

Queenie is a relatively small narrowboat, being only 50 feet in length, with a inside cabin length of probably 10 feet less than that. The stove on Queenie is the [Hobbit model from Salamander](https://salamanderstoves.com/product/the-hobbit-stove/). You can just see :




, if you're going to have a stove (some modern boats rely on just a radiator circuit, and possibly underfloor heating throughout, too) the choice of stove is important, and also based on what can be seen as constraints. There are smokeless fuel restrictions in the UK. There's the question of fuel too - you can get stoves that run on diesel, wood, or wood and coal ("multifuel"). 

I'm old fashioned at heart and prefer a multifuel stove, having had them in various houses in the past. There's also the question of output; some stoves would output far too much heat for such a small space, rendering them as useless as a cold unused lump of cast iron taking up otherwise valuable space. An output of around 5kW is about the sweet spot for a narrowboat of this size, and in this output ballpark there are some usual suspects, all great.
