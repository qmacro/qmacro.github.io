OData is a topic close to my heart.

## History

I was around when RSS was growing up, and
even contributed to the wider RSS community activities at the time. I was also
around during the creation of Atom and the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP).

I was around when Microsoft took Atom and APP and turned it into OData. I saw
its growth in the SAP ecosphere, from early adoption in the Duet space, onwards
and upwards. I also feel an affinity with OData because of its firm roots in
HTTP as the application protocol that it is, and the connection with
REpresentational State Transfer (REST). Heck, [my home and
workplace](https://qmacro.org/tags/narrowboat/) is named for that architectural
style.

## Opportunity

A while back, I'd authored a series of tutorials, formed into a mission called
"Take a Deep Dive into OData" on the SAP [Tutorial
Navigator](https://developers.sap.com/mission.scp-3-odata.html). Recently the
publicly available SAP system - upon which some of the tutorials were based -
was decomissioned.

So I now have an opportunity to rewrite the series, and decided to do so in the
open, as it were. Writing in public, to share my work, the tutorial roadmap,
and to give you the chance to send feedback and influence what goes in to that
series.

## Guidelines

I have some general guidelines that I'll be following:

- While the content may sometimes overlap with OData-adjacent topics such as CAP
  the series is about OData and OData alone
- The activities will be based on an OData service that I'll create early on,
  simple at first, and expanded in features and coverage as I work further
  through the series
- I'll make the implementation of that OData service available too
- The tutorial sources will be available in a public repo on GitHub, even
  before they appear on the Tutorial Navigator.

I'd love to hear your feedback, which you can provide in general via [this
issue
link](https://github.com/sap-tutorials/Tutorials/issues/new?title=Early%20feedback%20on%20the%20new%20OData%20mission&body=Let%20us%20know%20your%20thoughts%20on%20this%20new%20series%20-%20what%20you%20like,%20dislike,%20would%20like%20to%20see.%20Thank%20you!),
which I've also shared in the first paragraph of [the Intro section of the
first
tutorial](https://github.com/sap-tutorials/Tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/odata-dd-1-origins/odata-dd-1-origins.md#intro),
or via the tutorial-specific feedback links in the [Progress](#progress)
section.

Thanks!

## Progress

Here are links to the content for the OData Deep Dive tutorials so far, with
