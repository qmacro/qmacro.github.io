These are the notes summarising what was covered in [The Art and Science of CAP part 6][2], one episode in a mini series with Daniel Hutzel to explore the philosophy, the background, the technology history and layers that support and inform the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.

For all resources related to this series, see the post [The Art and Science of CAP][1].

This episode started with a review of the previous episode (part 5), based on the [notes for that episode][3].

## Improved display of service handlers

Daniel starts at around [21:53][101] in the cds REPL showing an improved display for the handlers of a service.

One of the many things I love about this series is that we see where Daniel is, a few steps ahead, with his CAP Node.js version which is always slightly in the near future for us, but what we glimpse in that future comes along and is available to us in the next release:

* the new cds REPL features `--run` and `--use` that we saw in the previous episode (see the [New cds REPL options][4] in [the notes to part 5][3]) and which he uses here to start things up _are now available to us too_
* during last week's episode Daniel's cds REPL was announcing itself as version 8.6, whereas we all had access to version 8.5 at that time; this week, where we now have access to version 8.6 (see the [December 2024 release notes][4]), Daniel's cds REPL is now announcing itself as version 8.7, always a step ahead but nothing hidden :-)
* the improved display of the handlers is still only available in this step ahead, but will no doubt be with us soon
