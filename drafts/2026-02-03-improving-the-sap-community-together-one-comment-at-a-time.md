description: A suggestion on how we can work together to make the SAP Community better.
---

As a Developer Advocate, I have the privilege of working with some amazing
colleagues in that team, but also in the wider Developer and Community
Relations organisation. For the size of the community, it's a small
organisation, and the folks are working hard to keep the wheels on the bus and
rolling in the right direction. But they can only do so much. In this post, I
want to highlight a challenge for us all, and how we can, again, collectively,
tackle it together.

## The challenge

I'm talking about content quality, which to a greater or lesser degree has for
a long time been a topic of debate both in the questions area and also the blog
post area. My relationship with the SAP Community platform goes back to day 1,
with SDN. Actually, well before that - creating the first online SAP community
in 1995, and co-creating the SAP Developer Network has caused me to never stop
caring for and worrying about those platforms, the people, and the content.

## Blog post quality

The quality of some blog posts on the SAP Community platform could be better. I
know it. You know it. We all know it. The number of people like you and me who
worry about this sort of thing is far outweighed by the larger number of folks
that make up the entire community. Over time we've made attempts to help
educate folks so that they create better content. Here are some of posts from
me on this topic:

- [Help us to help you - share your
  code](/blog/posts/2014/01/09/help-us-to-help-you-share-your-code/) (2014)
- [Help us to help you - good questions beget good
  answers](/blog/posts/2019/11/25/help-us-to-help-you-good-questions-beget-good-answers/)
  (2019)
- [Monday morning thoughts: a good blog
  post](/blog/posts/2018/08/27/monday-morning-thoughts-a-good-blog-post/)
  (2018)
- [Monday morning thoughts: on starting
  blogging](/blog/posts/2018/11/05/monday-morning-thoughts-on-starting-blogging/)
  (2018)

These attempts have worked, but only to a certain extent. Not only that, but we
have AI content generation to contend with too. While used appropriately, and
with thought, this approach can produce great results. But it can also produce
poor content, especially when the human component in this equation is not
entirely engaged with the purpose and process. Moreover, the ease with which poor
content can be produced is astounding. And so the problem has got worse over time,
and I can only see that progression accelerating.

## The SAP Community belongs to us

Like you, seeing blog posts that don't belong makes me sad and frustrated. So,
what should we do in this situation?

### Report important issues to the moderators

Well, first, there's a decision to be
made. Does the blog post break the important parts of the [Rules Of
Engagement](https://pages.community.sap.com/resources/rules-of-engagement)?
What are the important parts? Well, a bit of common sense will help. Does it
defame, injure or harass? Is the content illegal? Report it to the moderators.

### Feel empowered to call other issues out yourself

In other cases, don't report it. Use your voice publicly, by attaching a comment
to the post, explaining briefly what you consider inappropriate.
Encourage your fellow SAP Community members to do the same. Get them to
comment. Get them to upvote your comment.

Use the power of the collective, the power of the shared heart, to highlight,
educate, and yes, if you want to think of it in this way, to shame the author
into adjusting or removing the post and changing their ways.

This is how society works. And the SAP Community platform is an online society.
So feel empowered to treat it as one. Call the person out. Gently, politely,
firmly, however you see fit. You be the judge - we're all adults here. Don't
treat it as a kindergarten and go to the teacher whenever you dislike
something.

Why? Because the teachers are in short supply. The moderators behind the scenes
are working flat out on an ever increasing load of reports. Some that I would
definitely class as important, but many, many others that I'd class as trivial
and inappropriate.

## Final thoughts

Thanks for reading this far. Here's a TL;DR (yes, I know it should go at the top,
but think of it as the call to action instead).

_Stop reporting poor quality content, and similar transgressions. Call the
authors out yourself. Everyone is a member, and everyone is a moderator. And if
we moderate ourselves with respect, honesty and firmness, we just might turn
this giant sea-going cargo ship towards a better quality future._
