<P>There's a new Customer Engagement Initiative (CEI) for you to collaborate with SAP team members on a new service for hosting and serving frontend applications, a service that combines the HTML5 Repo and AppRouter capabilities, to provide a much simpler development, deployment and management experience, and introduce usage reporting and governance features too.</P>
<P>If, like me, you've built and deployed HTML5 apps to SAP Business Technology Platform, you'll know that there's some room for simplification and streamlining. Well - this is it!&nbsp;</P>
<P>Get involved by joining the CEI "<SPAN><A href="https://influence.sap.com/sap/ino/#campaign/3549" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">New service for hosting and serving frontend applications</A>". And hurry - registration for this CEI ends very soon!</SPAN></P>
