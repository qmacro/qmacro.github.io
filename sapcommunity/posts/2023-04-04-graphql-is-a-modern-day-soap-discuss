<P>A few years ago, in my "Monday Morning Thoughts" series, I published this post:</P><P><A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/03/monday-morning-thoughts-considering-graphql/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monday morning thoughts: considering GraphQL</A></P><P>in which I looked into GraphQL and how it compares to HTTP, REST and OData.</P><P>Yesterday I read and <A href="https://hachyderm.io/@qmacro/110136079918486910" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tooted about</A>&nbsp;an article&nbsp;<A href="https://betterprogramming.pub/graphql-from-excitement-to-deception-f81f7c95b7cf" target="_self" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GraphQL: From Excitement to Deception</A>&nbsp;which got me thinking again.</P><P>While I would of course encourage you to read both posts, I'd also love to know what you think about GraphQL, and about the thought conveyed in deliberately provocative title of this discussion.</P><P>I remember the advent of SOAP, and the dismay I felt in how it was over complex, orthogonal to HTTP (some might go so far as to say it abused HTTP as an application protocol), and not the golden solution to the perceived challenges.&nbsp;</P><P>GraphQL reminds me a lot of SOAP and those memories.</P><P>Change my mind! Point out the error of my ways!&nbsp;What do you think? I'd love to know.&nbsp;</P>
