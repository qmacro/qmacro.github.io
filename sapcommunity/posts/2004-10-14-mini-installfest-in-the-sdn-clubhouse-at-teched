Piers and I got hold of the latest WAS 6.40 demo system (NW4) from the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sap.com/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinuxLab</A> guys' stand here at SAP TechEd. It contains ABAP service pack 3 and Java/J2EE service pack 7.<BR />
<BR />
Since I had my <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2004/03/Biostar200.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">small Linux server</A> with me (that I used in my session this morning to demo some ICF stuff), we decided to blast away the previous NW4 install and have a <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2004/10/SapTechEd/InstallFest.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mini installfest</A>! Excellent. There's something about interesting things happening on computer screens that seem to attract the inner-geek in people ... within minutes we had a small crowd of people joining Piers, Mark, Gregor and me to watch the poor little server get hammered as the RPMs were installed from the DVD.<BR />
<BR />

I'm typing this post while the install goes on - here you can see a screenshot of the progress.<BR />

<STRONG>Small hack needed</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
I noticed straight away that the install.sh script supplied on the DVD crashed and burned immediately. I had a little look (open source rules again <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:">ðŸ™‚</span> and found it was because the script was trying to execute a KDE program 'kdialog' to display the licence and prompt for acceptance of the terms. (KDE is a desktop manager). I don't have KDE installed on the server, so it was almost a non-starter.<BR />
<BR />
Luckily I had a flash of inspiration, and created a symbolic link from a non-existent 'kdialog' to the ever-present X client utility 'xmessage' (I avoided copy-and-editing the script from the DVD as I would have had to change loads of relative pathnames and so on to get it to work from a new location). I reinvoked the install.sh script ... and everything started perfectly. Hurrah! (If you look <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2004/10/SapTechEd/InstallingNewNw4.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">closely</A> at the screenshot you can see evidence of this little hack.)<BR />
<BR />
Anyway, 4 RPMs have been installed by now - it's time for me to go back and have a look.<BR />

<STRONG>Update: Install complete</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
Ok, after less than two hours, my new NW4 system, service release one, is installed and up and running:<BR />

Nice work, LinuxLab folks!<BR />
