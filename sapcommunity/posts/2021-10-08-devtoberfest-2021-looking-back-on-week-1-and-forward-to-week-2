<EM>Here's a summary of what went on in week 1 of Devtoberfest 2021, and what to look forward to in week 2.</EM><BR />
<BR />
Week 1 of Devtoberfest 2021 - the "<A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021/tree/main/topics/Week1_Welcome" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Welcome to Devtoberfest</A>" week - is already almost done and dusted, phew!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Devtoberfest Launch Party</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
We kicked it off in style, with a fun live "Devtoberfest Launch Party" event. It was hosted by our fearless (and ultimately permanently relaxed) head of Developer and Community Relations <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">thomas.grassl</SPAN>, and starred a special guest, none other than SAP Executive Board Member and CTO <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">juergen.mueller</SPAN>.<BR />

We had some great interaction and chat during the live broadcast on YouTube, thank you everyone for that - it makes things more special.<BR />
<BR />
Note that live streams on YouTube are the backbone for Devtoberfest - if you look through <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021#key-dates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the events across the different weeks</A> you'll see that very many of them will be in the form of live streams on YouTube - on the <A href="https://youtube.com/sapdevs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Developers channel</A>. Now would be a good time to subscribe if you haven't done already, so you can set reminders for upcoming sessions.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>An Overview of Upcoming Weeks and the Contest</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
After the slot with Juergen, the Developer Advocates joined and talked about the different upcoming weeks. We also briefly covered the contest and how points can be earned; if you want to read more on this, check out the details on the home of Devtoberfest - our GitHub repo: <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021</A>. If you have any questions, let us know by creating an <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/devtoberfest-2021/issues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">issue</A> in the repo.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Information about Devtoberfest Gaming Night</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
We also mentioned the Devtoberfest Gaming Night, for which we have set up a Discord server - the main purpose of which is for us to coordinate who wants to play what with whom and where.<BR />
<BR />
There's an invite link to the Discord server over on the Devtoberfest repo, and it's here too: <A href="https://discord.com/invite/8EDCdsYe7p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://discord.com/invite/8EDCdsYe7p</A>.<BR />
<BR />
