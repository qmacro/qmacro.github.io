<EM>In this post I share a simple script that I use to recreate my Business Rules environment in the Cloud Foundry environment of my SAP Cloud Platform trial account. Scripting and the CLI in general is very powerful in today's "new mainframe" era.</EM><BR />
<BR />
It's <A href="https://youtu.be/hpMiXp8WLvo?t=680" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">no secret</A> that I feel that we're in the era of the new mainframe (it never really went away) and the power of the command line and terminal based user interfaces are more relevant and powerful than ever (yes, <A href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheFutureIsTerminal&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#TheFutureIsTerminal</A>!).<BR />
<BR />
Scripting is a much misunderstood discipline, and is a whole universe of languages, techniques, and contexts. But it's worth putting yourself on the learning path here, because it can be incredibly useful even for small tasks.<BR />
<BR />
While preparing and researching for content for the recent episodes of my <A href="https://bit.ly/handsonsapdev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#HandsOnSAPDev live stream series</A>, particularly in the area of exploring the Business Rules service in the Cloud Foundry environment on the SAP Cloud Platform (see in particular the annotated links for episodes <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/11/26/annotated-links-episode-44-of-hands-on-sap-dev-with-qmacro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44</A> and <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/01/02/annotated-links-episode-48-of-hands-on-sap-dev-with-qmacro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">48</A>), I decided to write a short script to help me recreate the Business Rules service and Editor facility ... I often clean out my environment, and sometimes even recreate my Cloud Foundry organisation and spaces, to clear cruft ready for the next live stream episode.<BR />
<BR />
It was so easy to write, I thought I'd share it, and perhaps encourage you to stare at it for a few minutes over a coffee to see how it works. It's very specific, and does what I want it to do (there's no smarts in there, but I have written it to be re-runnable).<BR />
<BR />
Here it is, warts and all:<BR />
<PRE class="language-perl"><CODE>#!/bin/bash<BR />
<BR />
# Prerequisites:<BR />
# - Cloud Foundry trial account on SAP Cloud Platform with <BR />
#   entitlement for Business Rules service and application runtime<BR />
# - Build tool 'mbt' installed globally<BR />
# - cf CLI installed with the 'multiapps' plugin installed<BR />
# - cf CLI already authenticated against the CF endpoint<BR />
<BR />
# Recommended:<BR />
# - Role collection containing RuleRepositorySuperUser and<BR />
#   RuleRuntimeSuperUser assigned tothe trial account user<BR />
<BR />
<BR />
# Show current CF target<BR />
echo Deploying to:<BR />
cf target<BR />
<BR />
# Create an instance of the service, with the free 'lite' service plan, called businessrules<BR />
# (reason for the name is because that's how it's referred to in the mta.yaml to come). If the<BR />
# service instance 'businessrules' already exists it won't be re-created.<BR />
cf create-service business-rules lite businessrules<BR />
<BR />
# Download the project containing the multi target application descriptor for the rules editor<BR />
# (see <A href="https://bit.ly/handsonsapdev#ep44" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/handsonsapdev#ep44</A> for background).<BR />
rm -rf archive.zip editor/<BR />
curl -o archive.zip -s <A href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP-samples/cloud-businessrules-samples/master/cf-apps/cf-businessruleseditor.zip" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP-samples/cloud-businessrules-samples/master/cf-apps/cf-businessruleseditor.zip</A><BR />
unzip -q -d editor ./archive.zip<BR />
<BR />
# Kick off the build - this should produce an archive in mta_archives/ directory.<BR />
cd editor/<BR />
mbt build<BR />
<BR />
# Deploy the archive<BR />
cf deploy mta_archives/businessruleseditor_0.0.1.mtar</CODE></PRE><BR />
Here's a brief description of each of the sections:<BR />
<BR />
I use the 'cf target' command to show the current Cloud Foundry target that my cf CLI tools is pointing to.<BR />
<BR />
With the 'cf create-service' command I create an instance of the 'business-rules' service, using the 'lite' service plan. Note that if an instance with this name exists already, another won't be created.<BR />
<BR />
I grab the archive containing the mta.yaml file that describes the Business Rules Editor multi target application (it's <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-businessrules-samples/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available on GitHub</A>), and then unzip it into a new directory 'editor/'.<BR />
<BR />
Before deploying this Editor it needs to be built, so that's next - within the 'editor/' directory I use the <A href="https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Cloud MTA Build Tool</A> 'mbt' to do this.<BR />
<BR />
The result of a successful build is that an 'mtar' archive file will be created in a new directory 'mta_archives/' - this archive file contains everything that should be pushed up to the Cloud Foundry environment, and I do this with the 'cf deploy' command.<BR />
<BR />
That's pretty much it - it works very well for me, doing 80% of what I need, for 20% of the effort (I spent around 15 mins writing it).<BR />
<BR />
In case you're interested, here's some sample output, so you can get a feel for how it runs.<BR />
