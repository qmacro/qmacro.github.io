<IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2003/12/small_cebit_r3linux_38813.jpg" />&nbsp;Ahh, it's always great to be able to attend the world's biggest ICT (information and communication technology) fair - <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.cebit2004.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CeBIT</A>. And of course being an SAP hacker, it goes without saying that a visit to the SAP stand is a must.<BR />
<BR />
I was there way back when, with colleagues and friends - among them my SAP hacking partner-in-crime Piers, on the historical occasion of SAP's CeBIT announcement of R/3 on Linux. We were even so geeky as to take a picture&nbsp;recording the event, under the watchful eye of Tux the Linux penguin mascot.<BR />
<BR />
Anyway, one big reason to visit Hannover in March is because SAP is intending to make available a new version of the Linux-based evaluation WAS system, at release 6.40, including the all-important ABAP stack. Thanks SAP, especially the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sap.com/linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux Lab</A> folks and also those at SAP who bore the brunt of my recent emails about this - you know who you are <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":winking_face:">ðŸ˜‰</span><BR />
<BR />
Yippee!<BR />

Also, Alexander H from the Linux Lab was kind enough to send <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://listserv.sap.com/pipermail/linux.general/2003-December/003778.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reply</A> to an email on the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://listserv.sap.com/mailman/listinfo/linux.general" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linux.general</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mailing list.<BR />
