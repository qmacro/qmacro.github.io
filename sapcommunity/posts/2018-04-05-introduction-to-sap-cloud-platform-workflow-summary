Yesterday I gave a webcast for ASUG entitled "Introduction to SAP Cloud Platform Workflow". This is a short post that pulls together all the resources related to that webcast.<BR />
<BR />
The SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service is a relatively new service (it was made available mid 2017) but already has many features and it's definitely worth looking into and learning more about. That's the reason I've been looking into it, and I'd encourage you to do the same.<BR />
<BR />
The webcast was recorded, and you can access the entire recording here on the ASUG site: <A href="https://discuss.asug.com/docs/DOC-49163" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Introduction to SAP Cloud Platform Workflow</A>. This page has a link to the recording itself (which you need to enter some basic info to see) and a link to the slides in PDF form.<BR />
<BR />
There were only a few slides; the bulk of the webcast was a demo of various Workflow service features, which I did using the workflow definition I created originally to write a blog post series. The demo itself is around 30 mins long and I've also made it separately available on YouTube (I'd pre-recorded it in case of technical difficulties during the live webcast itself). It's here: <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR42fhOUmq4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Introduction to SAP Cloud Platform Workflow - Demo</A>.<BR />

<BR />
The workflow definition I used was one relating to beer recommendations, and I wrote extensively about it, and my journey of discovery while I built it, in a 10 part blog post series here on the SAP Community. That series is "<A href="http://pipetree.com/qmacro/blog/2018/01/16/discovering-scp-workflow/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Discovering SCP Workflow</A>" and there's a table of contents pointing to each of the parts at that link too. Here are the subjects that the parts cover:&nbsp;The Monitor · Instance Initiation · Using Postman · Service Proxy Workflow Definition · User Tasks · Component Startup Recommendation UI · Script Tasks · Service Tasks.<BR />
<BR />
During the webcast, I'd shown a slide with links to various useful resources. Here they are too:<BR />

Finally, this webcast was just one in an entire series that's happening over 2018.&nbsp;<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">tammy.powlas3</SPAN>&nbsp;put together a great post summarising all of them:&nbsp;<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/01/save-the-date-your-guide-to-every-upcoming-workflow-2018-webcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save the Date!
