<P>Starting the CAP server with<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>cds watch<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is great for tight development loops at design time, especially with the built-in in-memory SQLite persistence layer, seeded by data in CSV files. When the server notices files have changed, it automatically restarts, which is great.</P><P>But sometimes you want to maintain files and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>not</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>have the server restart, perhaps because you have made modifications or additions to the data set that's being served, and don't want to lose that by such a restart.</P><P>Here's a quick hack to achieve that.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-993480777">Behind the scenes</H2><P>If you set the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-log#debug-env-variable" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">DEBUG environment variable</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>appropriately when running<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>cds watch, like this:</P><P>&nbsp;</P><pre class="lia-code-sample language-shell"><code>DEBUG=cli cds watch</code></pre><P>&nbsp;</P><P>then you see a little bit more of what's going on behind the scenes:</P><P>&nbsp;</P><pre class="lia-code-sample language-text"><code>[cds] - /cds 7.6.3 loaded: /usr/lib/node_modules/@sap/cds-dk/node_modules/@sap/cds
