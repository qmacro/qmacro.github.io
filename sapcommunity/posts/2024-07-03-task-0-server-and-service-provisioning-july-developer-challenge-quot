This is so your API endpoints within services served by a CAP server can be reached from the TESTER service and checked for "correctness" (read the main challenge blog post<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/sap-developer-challenge-quot-reverse-quot-apis/ba-p/13749653" target="_blank">July Developer Challenge - "Reverse APIs"</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>for what this means).</P><P>What you need to do is simply follow the guidelines in the "<A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653#toc-hId-232540630" target="_blank">Making your service available to test</A>" in the 2024-07 "Reverse APIs" SAP Developer Challenge blog post, choosing either the "<A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653#toc-hId-165109844" target="_blank">Simple deployment to BTP</A>" approach, or the "<A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653#toc-hId--31403661" target="_blank">Local deployment plus ngrok tunnel</A>" approach, or indeed an approach of your own choosing.</P><P>NOTE: Whichever approach you choose, please ensure you choose a unique application name, ideally one that relates to your SAP Community ID. For example, my SAP Community ID is "qmacro" hence the application names in the guidelines referenced here are "qmacro-simplest-deployment" and "qmacro-simplest-deployment". Please make sure you use different names<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":thumbs_up:">üëç</span></P><P>In this particular "pre" task (Task 0), there's no testing of whatever you get up and running; testing of your service endpoints starts with Task 1.</P><P>This thread is for us to discuss working through this task, to make comments and observations, and also to help each other get through the steps needed.</P><P>Optionally, once you get a simple CAP server up and running and the service URL exposed to the cloud, let us know here in the comments and share the URL.</P><P>Other than that, there's nothing to be done, nothing specific you need to have your test service endpoint return, and there will be nothing tested. It's just to make sure you know how to spin something up for the remaining 10 tasks.</P><P><STRONG>Remember</STRONG></P><UL><LI>You do NOT need to call the TESTER service for this task.</LI><LI>When choosing an application name, choose something unique, for example related to your SAP Community ID</LI></UL><P>Off you go!</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
