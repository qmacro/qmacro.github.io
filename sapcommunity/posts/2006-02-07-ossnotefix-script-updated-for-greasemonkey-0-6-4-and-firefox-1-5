<DIV class="jive-rendered-content"><P>Last year, I got so frustrated at the pain of using the SAP Service Marketplace, and particularly OSS notes, that I got up and did something about it - I wrote 'OssNoteFix', a Greasemonkey script that:</P><UL><LI>put the OSS number and note title in the page's title (and therefore the browser window/tab too)</LI><LI>made OSS note numbers in the text of the OSS note into clickable links</LI><LI>removed the dreadful frames so you can, e.g. bookmark the notes</LI></UL><P>You can read more about it in the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=40345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacking the SAP service portal to make OSS notes better</A> or just <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/screencast.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">watch the screencast</A> of how it works.</P><P>Since then, new versions of <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Firefox</A> (1.5) and <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Greasemonkey</A> (0.6.4, for Firefox 1.5) have been released. Greasemonkey's security model has changed, and OssNoteFix stopped working. Well, this weekend I finally found a couple of tuits and got round to updating the script, which is now focused on running with these releases of Greasemonkey and Firefox (if you haven't upgraded, do so now!).</P><P>So without further ado, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/ossnotefix.user.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">OssNoteFix 0.2</A> is available for installation.</P><P>For those of you who are interested, and / or want to be confused, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/a/6257" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here's some background info</A>. Of course, you can look at the code to see how it works and what changes were made, and even modify it to suit your own purposes, because it's Open Source.</P><P>Share and enjoy!</P></DIV>
