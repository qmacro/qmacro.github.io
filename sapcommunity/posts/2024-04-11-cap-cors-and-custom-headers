<P>A colleague asked me if I could add CORS support to a service I was running, built with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP). CAP already has some basic support for CORS, so I dug in. Here's what I learned, about CORS headers, preflight requests, CAP custom servers and more.</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>The<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/approuter" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">@sap/approuter</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>has full support for CORS but I wanted to find out about what CAP offers and how to extend it. Specifically, this exploration was made with<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>@sap/cds<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>at version 7.8.0.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><H2 id="toc-hId-991725056">Test service</H2><P>Before diving in, let's create the simplest server that could possibly work<A href="https://qmacro.org/blog/posts/2024/03/30/cap-cors-and-custom-headers/#footnotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">1</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to explore CORS support in CAP. First, a minimal project:</P><PRE># /home/user/work/scratch

&lt; X-Powered-By: Express
&lt; access-control-allow-origin: https://qmacro.org
&lt; access-control-allow-methods: GET,PUT</PRE><P>In other words, a response that tells the browser "yes,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>PUT<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>requests from this origin are allowed".</P><P>And that is exactly what the default server's CORS handling mechanism is doing in the condition that checks whether the HTTP method is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>OPTIONS, i.e. if it's a preflight request. It adds the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Access-Control-Allow-Methods<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>header to response to preflight requests, and includes all the "usual suspect" HTTP methods (GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE).</P><P>For testing, we can actually construct a preflight request, using curl's<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>--request<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>option to be able to specify the HTTP method to use, so that we can see a preflight request/response for real.
