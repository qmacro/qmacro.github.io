The Business Rules service is available on the SAP Cloud Platform (SCP) and is categorised within the "Integration" section, along with other services such as the Workflow service, and in fact the two services complement each other very well - I like to think of them as siblings.<BR />

Last week I was honoured to appear as a guest on the SAP CodeTalk series hosted by&nbsp;<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">ian.thain</SPAN>&nbsp;and the subject was the Business Rules service. Here's the interview:<BR />

I thought it would be useful to gather together a few links to help get you started on your journey of discovery.<BR />
<BR />
You should absolutely visit the main <A href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/BUSINESS_RULES" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Rules landing page in help.sap.com</A> because it contains pointers to key resources such as the core documentation, the API documentation on the SAP API Hub, and a "what's new" section.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">muralidaran.shanmugham2</SPAN>&nbsp;has a nice multi-part series on combining Workflow and Business Rules in an example scenario:&nbsp;<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2017/07/31/implementing-a-user-self-registration-scenario-using-workflow-and-business-rules-in-sap-cloud-platform-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementing a user self-registration scenario using Workflow and Business rules in SAP Cloud Platform</A><BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">archana.shukla</SPAN> has written a number of useful posts on the Business Rules service - definitely worth having a browse through these.<BR />
<BR />
The Business Rules service was first available in SCP's Neo environment - it's now also available in the trial landscape of the Cloud Foundry (CF) environment. This in itself is interesting as it's a pattern that we could see more often. It's also a good way to start understanding more about the CF environment, as you have something similar to compare and contrast across the two different environments. See Archana's post for more info:&nbsp;<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/29/quick-start-guide-to-sap-business-rules-service-in-cloud-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quick Start Guide to SAP Cloud Platform Business Rules Service in Cloud Foundry</A>.<BR />
<BR />
As I mentioned in the video, there's a library of controls in UI5 for Business Rules - you can find them in the API reference here: <A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.rules.ui" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sap.rules.ui</A>. There's also a related tutorial available in the UI5 SDK (something I've only just discovered!) which is here: <A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/67fcb301d0504fd4a24915edf4058c51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rule Builder Control</A>&nbsp;where you can learn how to embed a rule builder control into your application.<BR />
<BR />
And last but not least, there's a tag here in the SAP Community that you can follow, to see <A href="https://answers.sap.com/tags/73554900100800000842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Rules Q&amp;A</A> and <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/tags/73554900100800000842/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post content</A>.<BR />

Happy Business Ruling!
