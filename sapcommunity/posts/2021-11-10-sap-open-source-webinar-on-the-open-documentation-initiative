<EM>Here's the information about an SAP Open Source webinar we held yesterday about the Open Documentation Initiative.</EM><BR />
<BR />
SAP's Open Source Program Office has a <A href="https://webinars.sap.com/ospo-webinar-series/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar series</A> with a wealth of interesting talks on open source and standards topics. Yesterday I was honoured to be able to give a session on the Open Documentation Initiative.<BR />
<BR />
You can access the replay any time - head over to this <A href="https://webinars.sap.com/ospo-webinar-series/en/webinar-replays" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar replays page</A> and select the session.<IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/11/screenshot-2021-11-10-at-13.40.17.png" /><BR />
<BR />
I included lots of links in the slides, but rather than just present the slides here, I thought I'd share a curated set of the links for further reading and reference.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Precedence</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
In the Precedence section, I talked about the fact that we're not the first to do this, and gave examples from GitHub and Microsoft. The blog post linked at the bottom of one of these slides is <A href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/teamblog/introducing-docs-microsoft-com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Introducing docs.microsoft.com</A> and is a great read. In this section I also showed a couple of examples of collaboration I'd enjoyed with the Microsoft and GitHub documentation teams:<BR />
<UL><BR />
 	<LI>I submitted an issue to the Azure Docs repo: <A href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/74539" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Deletion of (second) node resource group - confusion / clarity</A> which resulted in an improvement to the documentation in question</LI><BR />
 	<LI>I submitted a pull request to the main GitHub Docs repo: <A href="https://github.com/github/docs/pull/2211" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">include 'shell command' as a possible step task</A> which was merged and improved the documentation in question in a small but important way</LI><BR />
</UL><BR />
<STRONG>Gamification</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
In the Gamification section I referred to the two missions in SAP Community that relate to the Open Documentation Initiative - you can find them in the <A href="https://community.sap.com/resources/missions-badges?q=documentation" target="_blank">Collaboration Missions</A> area.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Guidelines</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
The guidelines explain how you can contribute, and are in the SAP Help Portal in the <A href="https://help.sap.com/products/open-documentation-initiative/contribution-guidelines/readme.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Guidelines</A> section. It is to page in this section that we created and submitted a change, in the form of a pull request, <A href="https://github.com/SAP-docs/contribution-guidelines/pull/82" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">avoid having the word appropriate twice</A>, live during the webinar. This pull request has been merged <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:">ðŸ™‚</span><BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>More info</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
To wrap up, I provided a few links, which are here (some are already shared, above):<BR />
