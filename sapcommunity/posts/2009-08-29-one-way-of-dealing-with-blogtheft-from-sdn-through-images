I'm sure you're all aware of the recent <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23blogtheft" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#blogtheft</A> issue - where some rogue has been lifting content lock stock and barrel from here and reproducing it - sans author name - on their website <A href="https://community.sap.com/www.sap-abap4.com" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.sap-abap4.com</A>. <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=50641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stop Thief - It's #blogtheft!</A> and <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=50669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stolen Content</A> have blogged about it here already.<BR />
<BR />
In Craig's Friday Morning Report yesterday, I suggested:<BR />
<BR />
<EM>13:32 qmacro: get SAP hosting to send alternative “STOLEN!” images to rogue referrer – Google “image theft apache” for examples</EM><BR />
<BR />
and straight after the conference call finished, I thought I'd demo how that could be done. I implemented such a mechanism for images on an SDN blog post of mine, images that just happened to be hosted on my machine. I wrote about how that was done in a weblog post:<BR />

<BR />
This morning, @thorstenster alerted me to the fact that SAP have now implemented this for images hosted here on SDN:<BR />

<BR />
Now that's a <STRONG>great</STRONG> reaction! Kudos to the SAP Community Network hackers who look after the servers here. To implement something like that in such a short space of time and on the production servers ... I take my hat off to you folks. Well done.<BR />
