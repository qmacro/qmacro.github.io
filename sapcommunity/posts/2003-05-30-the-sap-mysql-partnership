<DIV class="jive-rendered-content"><SPAN>I keep hearing reports that the recent </SPAN><A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sapdb.org/7.4/pdf/pressrelease_eng.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">announcement of cooperation</A><SPAN>between </SPAN><A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sap-ag.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP AG</A><SPAN> and</SPAN><A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MySQL AB</A><SPAN> has been making the community unhappy. What's the deal? I don't understand what's not to like here. SAP aren't giving up development of DBMS technology, they're just giving up the marketing of it. And what a great injection for MySQL, makers of my favourite open source DB. </SPAN><P></P><SPAN>IMO making and maintaining DBMS products isn't one of SAP's core business drivers. Never was, never should be. SAP's strengths lie in a combination of building good application code, application development infrastructures, and abstraction layers for underlying common technologies like databases, spool mechanisms, TP monitors (ok this was more an R/2 thing) and so on, so that their application and technology products run on lots of platform / software combinations. SAP rescued ADABAS D (and renamed it </SPAN><A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sapdb.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP DB</A><SPAN>). I think that was a good move. They're now sharing the technology and their support to an open source DB vendor with a good name. </SPAN><P></P><SPAN>As long as the relationship remains open source, what can be seen as bad about the partnership? </SPAN></DIV>
