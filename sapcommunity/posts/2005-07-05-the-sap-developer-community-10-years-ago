Yesterday <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">alan.rickayzen/blog</SPAN> pointed us (<A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=40523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whopping big collection of tips for developing workflows</A>) to a collection of tips on developing workflows, hosted by MIT, on a mailing list called 'SAP-WUG'.<BR />
<BR />
I guessed that 'SAP-WUG' is a descendant of the venerable 'SAP-R3-L' mailing list hosted by MIT, and I was immediately whisked back years to when that was formed, and beyond.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qmacro/23713365/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2005/07/small_mitarbeiterkongressflasche_40707.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></A> Before SAP-R3-L there were two mailing lists; 'sapr3-list' run by Bryan Thorp in Canada, and 'merlin' run by me, in the UK. We both formed our lists in the first half of 1995, and for a while didn't know about each other (or each other's list). Running a list ate a <STRONG>lot</STRONG> of resources, both in computing terms and in human terms - I remember I was hacking on SAP at an oil company up in Aberdeen at the time, and after a day's work would return to my hotel room and spend a couple of hours in 'list maintenance' mode each night. It was pretty time consuming.<BR />
<BR />
Eventually MIT approached us both and gave us the opportunity to merge the two lists, and have the new list, which would be called SAP-R3-L, hosted and run by MIT. We still would have administrivia tasks, which we'd share and delegate, but it was a great offer (thanks MIT) and SAP-R3-L has left a great legacy.<BR />
<BR />
Anyway, this year marks the tenth anniversary of <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.cpub.com/archives/saplist/saplistinfo.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sapr3-list, merlin, and SAP-R3-L</A>.<BR />
<BR />
The nearest thing I could find to commemorate was this bottle of bubbly, handed out to people in Walldorf (I was working there at the time) at a party in the car park.<BR />
<BR />
So, happy anniversary, SAP mailing lists one and all!<BR />
