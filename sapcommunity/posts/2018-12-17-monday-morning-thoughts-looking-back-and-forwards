<EM>In this post, I look back on the posts in this series, reflect upon the journey we've made, and think about what 2019 might hold for us.</EM><BR />
<BR />
The holiday season is pretty much upon us, and for many it's a time for bringing things to a close, with a view to getting some rest and making mental room for what's to come next year. So it is with me and this series.<BR />
<BR />
I started this series back in March, not really paying too much attention to the regularity that the title of the post suggested. I made things worse, as it were, by writing a second Monday morning thoughts post on the following Monday. Thereafter I had some folks reach out to me saying that they were looking forward to the next instalment. Whoops! What had I done? I hadn't really set out with the intention of writing each and every Monday. I'd thought I'd write on the occasional Monday here and there.<BR />
<BR />
I guess it all turned out OK in the end, and perhaps even became a nice challenge for me, to write something weekly, something that was hopefully interesting, relating to aspects and ideas in our SAP ecosphere and beyond. Perhaps it even became a micro obsession of mine, as I found myself publishing a post on my birthday (<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/03/monday-morning-thoughts-considering-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Considering GraphQL</A>) and another from the balcony of our hotel room in Gran Canaria (on <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/11/12/monday-morning-thoughts-longevity-and-loose-coupling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">longevity and loose coupling</A>). That's not to say that I'm encouraging you to write on your days off - but perhaps I am suggesting that you should follow your passions and do what you feel is right.<BR />

I've had the privilege of publishing audio recordings of a few of the posts on&nbsp;<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">jakob_bourne</SPAN>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Former Member's excellent podcast show <A href="https://anchor.fm/sap-community-podcast" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Coffee Corner Radio</A>&nbsp;and have been surprised and delighted to find folks coming to say hello at the SAP TechEd locations this year saying they've been reading and enjoying the posts.<BR />
<BR />
In total, including this one, there are 38 posts in the&nbsp;series and they're all available via the usertag "<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/tag/mondaymorningthoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mondaymorningthoughts</A>" (hurray for <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">folksonomy</A> systems). If you're curious, yes I did write them all on each Monday morning; while I might have mused on topics over the weekends, it would have been only semi-consciously; I got to grips with the subjects at hand there and then at the very start of each week (often helped by a run before dawn - my favourite time).<BR />
<BR />
Talking of curiosity, I was wondering this morning what the dominant subjects might turn out to be. So this morning I grabbed all of the user tags from each of the posts, cleaned them up, and fed them into a <A href="https://tagcrowd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tag cloud generator</A>.<BR />
<BR />

<BR />
In one sense, what it produced was not unpredictable.<BR />
<BR />
But what I noticed was that the largest tag, <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/tag/cloudnative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloudnative</A>, was the subject of, even the title of, my very first Monday morning thoughts post: "<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/26/monday-morning-thoughts-cloud-native/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Native</A>". This made me smile, but also reflect on where we are in the SAP Cloud Platform journey together. And I think that's what I have in mind when I think of 2019 and what it holds in store for us.<BR />
<BR />
We're moving ever closer to open tools, standards &amp; processes, with Cloud Foundry as our new bread &amp; butter, and with Kubernetes, Knative and concepts the <A href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">12 factor app</A>&nbsp;being understood and embraced. Moreover, we have serverless offerings becoming a reality on SAP Cloud Platform, with functions, messaging and backend as a service features available now. Serverless is even topic of the month here in the SAP Community!<BR />
<BR />
&nbsp;<BR />

<BR />
So 2019 has lots of exciting things in store for us. What I know for sure is that we'll continue to learn, with new topics to embrace and existing topics to master (see "<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/10/monday-morning-thoughts-digging-deeper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digging deeper</A>"), and we'll continue to grow as an ecosphere and as a community.<BR />
<BR />
This then marks the end of the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/tag/mondaymorningthoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monday morning thoughts series</A>, at least in its current form. I've really enjoyed writing them, and that's mostly because of you folks - your comments, engagement, and conversations that have started because of what you've read. Thank you, enjoy the holiday season, and I look forward to seeing you in the new year!<BR />
