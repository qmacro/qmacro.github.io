<EM>Be informed about updates to where the btp CLI configuration is stored by default.</EM><BR />
<BR />
This post relates directly to the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/14/sap-tech-bytes-btp-cli-managing-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI â€“ managing configuration</A> post, and provides a brief update to the information in there.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-960234109">Latest version</H2><BR />
Since that post, the btp CLI has gone through a number of updates. One of these updates has been to where configuration is stored (and looked for) by default. This is independent of your runtime environment; while the previous post showed an example in the SAP Business Application Studio (App Studio), this update applies to all contexts where you run the latest version of the btp CLI.<BR />
<BR />
At the time of writing, according to the information in the <A href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">canonical home for the btp CLI</A>, the latest version of the btp CLI is 2.14.0:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2022/02/screenshot-2022-02-17-at-11.38.37.png" /></P><BR />
This is also what the <CODE>getbtpcli</CODE> script reports (see <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/01/sap-tech-bytes-btp-cli-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI - installation</A> for more on this utility):<BR />
<PRE class="language-perl"><CODE>; getbtpcli --test<BR />
Version is 2.14.0</CODE></PRE><BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-763720604">New location</H2><BR />
The main btp CLI configuration is stored in a file called <CODE>config.json</CODE>. There are sometimes other files that contain configuration too, and these, along with <CODE>config.json</CODE>, are stored by default in a directory called <CODE>.btp/</CODE>.<BR />
<BR />
In the past, the default location for this <CODE>.btp/</CODE> directory was in a <CODE>.cache/</CODE> directory in your home directory. So for me, while working in my local dev container, would have been, <EM>previously</EM>:<BR />
<PRE class="language-abap"><CODE># /home/user<BR />
; tree .cache/.btp<BR />
.cache/.btp<BR />
|-- autocomplete<BR />
|   `-- scripts<BR />
|       `-- sapbtpcli-autocomplete.plugin.sh<BR />
`-- config.json<BR />
</CODE></PRE><BR />
(here you can see examples of other files alongside <CODE>config.json</CODE>).<BR />
<BR />
There is now a new default location.<BR />
<BR />
Instead of <CODE>.cache/</CODE>, the default location for <CODE>.btp/</CODE> is now&nbsp; <CODE>.config/</CODE>. So now it looks like this:<BR />
<PRE class="language-abap"><CODE># /home/user<BR />
; tree .config/.btp<BR />
.config/.btp<BR />
|-- autocomplete<BR />
|   `-- scripts<BR />
|       `-- sapbtpcli-autocomplete.plugin.sh<BR />
`-- config.json<BR />
</CODE></PRE><BR />
This is a great move because it aligns with the <A href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec.latest.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">XDG Base Directory Specification</A> which I mentioned in the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/14/sap-tech-bytes-btp-cli-managing-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</A>.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-567207099">New environment variable</H2><BR />
Not only has the default location changed from <CODE>.cache/</CODE> to <CODE>.config/</CODE>, but also the environment variable that you can set to tell the btp CLI where your configuration is, has changed too.<BR />
<BR />
Previous it was <CODE>SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG</CODE>. This reflected the name of the btp CLI at the time (<CODE>sapcp</CODE>).<BR />
<BR />
It is now <CODE>BTP_CLIENTCONFIG</CODE>, which reflects the current name of the btp CLI of course.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-370693594">My configuration location</H2><BR />
As I mentioned in the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/14/sap-tech-bytes-btp-cli-managing-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI - managing configuration</A> post, I like to organise my configuration directories within my <CODE>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</CODE> location (i.e. <CODE>$HOME/.config/</CODE>) according to the name of the tool or utility, but as normal directories, rather than hidden ones (the period at the start of the <CODE>.btp/</CODE> directory name means that it is to be treated as a hidden directory).<BR />
<BR />
This is what the contents of my <CODE>$HOME/.config/</CODE> directory looks like:<BR />
<PRE class="language-abap"><CODE>; ls .config<BR />
./ btp/ g/ htop/ procps/ tmuxinator/<BR />
../ configstore/ gcloud/ kitty/ ranger/ vim/<BR />
asciinema/ docker/ gh/ lf/ so/ weechat/<BR />
autocomplete/ exercism/ gitui/ newsboat/ stack/ yamllint/</CODE></PRE><BR />
Note that my btp CLI configuration directory is not hidden, i.e. it's <CODE>btp/</CODE> rather than <CODE>.btp/</CODE>. That's my personal choice, and I use the <CODE>BTP_CLIENTCONFIG</CODE> environment variable to tell the btp CLI that this is where I have my configuration:<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-174180089">Moving over</H2><BR />
If you're still using <CODE>SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG</CODE>, don't worry - there's a grace period; the btp CLI will still honour the use of this environment variable, to give you time to change over to <CODE>BTP_CLIENTCONFIG</CODE>. But I'd encourage you to do that soon!<BR />
