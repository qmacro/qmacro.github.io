As <A href="https://twitter.com/fredverheul" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fred Verheul</A> remarked: "Fashionistas"!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h05m38s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:05:38</A>:</STRONG> Learning from Christian how CAPM (or "CAP") came about.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h10m15s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:10:15</A>:</STRONG> Hearing from Christian about how CAPM fits into the SAP developers overall toolkit today.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h13m20s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:13:20</A>:</STRONG> Talking about how guidance and opinionated software &amp; best practices can be useful in a world full of choices.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h14m40s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:14:40</A>:</STRONG> Finding out where CAPM is used by internal teams within SAP, as this is often where toolkits and other offerings start out and find their feet. One example is the app formerly known as "Excise Duty", a special tax app for breweries in Germany. Wonderful!<BR />
<BR />

(Node.js support is coming back to SAP Web IDE, for CDS 3.x ... and it's already possible to build and run Java locally).<BR />

Announcement on the stream that a new version of the <CODE><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1387241">@Sisn</a>/cds</CODE> is being released today, and Christian will be pressing the big red button.<BR />

With the REPL you can programmatically interact with the runtime. See <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/02/04/cloudfoundryfun-upgrade-cloud-foundry-with-a-new-repl-feature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudFoundryFun #1 – Upgrade Cloud Foundry With A New REPL Feature</A> by <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">mariusobert</SPAN> for more on REPLs.<BR />

<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h22m56s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:22:56</A>:</STRONG> Time for the live demonstrations by Christian.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h24m08s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:24:08</A>:</STRONG> A message from OBS, my streaming software: "Streaming encoding overload"!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h24m44s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:24:44</A>:</STRONG> Starting to look at a slightly updated version of the "bookshop" demo app, which is going to be used consistently throughout the CAP rollout materials, especially for Node.js.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h25m10s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:25:10</A>:</STRONG> The updated VS Code has new features, which Christian briefly explores, before enabling the "screencast mode" feature. And he's bringing the feature to Eclipse, too. Awesome!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h27m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:27:00</A>:</STRONG> Taking a look at the <CODE>data-model.cds</CODE>, talking about how easy it is to navigate through the code, across the files, in VS Code too. Remembering that CAP uses the NPM module system to load up and find CDS files.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h28m35s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:28:35</A>:</STRONG> Mention of dependencies that can be defined, in <CODE>package.json</CODE>, on another CDS model, using the <CODE>git</CODE> URL scheme.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h29m30s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:29:30</A>:</STRONG> Noting that you don't need to include the <CODE>.cds</CODE> extension explicitly when referring to other files. This gives the module provider the chance to provide not only CDS sources but compiled CSN. Nice! Also, putting files manually directly into the <CODE>node_modules</CODE> directory works too - you don't need to use NPM to install.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h31m52s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:31:52</A>:</STRONG> Showing code completion for file and directory paths when specifying a <CODE>using</CODE> statement, powered also by the Language Server Protocol (LSP).<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h34m10s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:34:10</A>:</STRONG> Relaying Fred Verheul's question on extending S/4HANA, on reusing existing data models from the ABAP backends, just applying the necessary extensions. The answer involves translating the OData API back into CSN!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h36m45s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:36:45</A>:</STRONG> Looking at the elements in the <CODE>managed</CODE> type (in <CODE>common.cds</CODE>) that provide administrative data, avoiding re-invention each time. A lovely simple solution, with some complexity &amp; heavy lifting hidden, no doubt!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h38m45s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:38:45</A>:</STRONG> Looking at the <CODE>localized</CODE> keyword, which is a feature that is nearing completion at the time of recording. We got a sneak preview on Christian's machine, too, in the context of the Fiori frontend part to the bookshop sample, which is also new. Brontë's "Wuthering Heights" in German is "Sturmhöhe". Who knew?! The localisation feature requires some heavy lifting on the database, as you can well imagine.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h43m38s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:43:38</A>:</STRONG> You don't need to specify the <CODE>compile</CODE> option as it's default for the <CODE>cds</CODE> command, so when Christian uses <CODE>cds srv/ -2 sql</CODE> it works fine. Here in the output we see a window into how things are generated underneath for the localisation. Note that it's different between SQL and HANA because of the features that can be used in HANA itself.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h45m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:45:00</A>:</STRONG> Looking at some early works on temporal aspects of data, with the abstract entity <CODE>temporal</CODE>, which we recognise from HR data sets.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h47m25s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:47:25</A>:</STRONG> Discussing <A href="https://twitter.com/vobu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Volker Buzek</A>'s question on exposing CDS as openAPI, and then Pierre Dominique's question on exposing a GraphQL endpoint (for more on GraphQL see <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/09/03/monday-morning-thoughts-considering-graphql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monday morning thoughts: considering GraphQL</A>). GraphQL is on the roadmap but with no fixed date yet.<BR />

<BR />
<STRONG><A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFLlTpwOujw&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h55m06s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:55:06</A>:</STRONG> Mentioning a small gotcha I encountered when trying to use <CODE>excluding</CODE> - I'd forgotten to re-deploy to the persistence layer - the keyword implies modifications at the view level in the database (note that the services are reflected using views in the database, leveraging native database capabilities rather than writing code above the persistence layer).<BR />
<BR />

<BR />
