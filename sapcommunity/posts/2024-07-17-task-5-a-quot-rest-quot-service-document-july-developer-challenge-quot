<P>This is a task in the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653" target="_blank">July Developer Challenge - "Reverse APIs"</A>.</P><P>This task focuses a little more on the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>plain<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>service you set up in the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-discussions/task-4-plain-quot-rest-quot-endpoint-july-developer-challenge-quot-reverse/m-p/13760488" target="_blank">previous task</A>, and is more for us to think more about the differences and similarities between services served with the OData and "REST" protocols.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-1020235079">The requirements</H2><P>Here are the specific requirements for this task.</P><P>If you already have the basic<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>plain<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>service you set up in the the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-discussions/task-4-plain-quot-rest-quot-endpoint-july-developer-challenge-quot-reverse/m-p/13760488" target="_blank">previous task</A>, then you actually have everything you need to submit a test request to the TESTER.</P><P>Why? Because this time, your submission to the tester will be to ask it to retrieve and check ... the service document of your service.</P><P>As well as submitting your service to the TESTER, we want you to share your thoughts on this "service document". What's in it? What happens when you add an entity definition to the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>plain<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>service, in the CDS model? Does it make sense to have such a service document? Does it differ from a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html#_Toc31358911" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">service document of an OData service</A>? If so, how? (Hint: Use the appropriate annotation to switch and see what happens).</P><P>In addition, here's another aspect to ponder, and we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. OData is a fantastic example of a RESTful API. One of the well known documents that every OData service offers is the metadata document, at the path<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>/$metadata. This is a rich (EDMX-based) description of everything that the OData service offers.</P><P>While there's a "service document" of sorts in a plain "REST" protocol served service, is there an equivalent? What else might be useful here? (Hint: have a look at the options in the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>cds compile<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>command).</P><H2 id="toc-hId-823721574">Submitting to the TESTER</H2><P>Now you're ready to submit your CANDIDATE service, with the service document, to the TESTER!</P><H3 id="toc-hId-756290788">The payload</H3><P>The task identifier you need to supply in the payload of your submission is:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>plain-serviceDocument</STRONG>.</P><P>You'll have already done this sort of thing<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-discussions/july-developer-challenge-quot-reverse-apis-quot-task-1-your-first-service/m-p/13752205" target="_blank">previously</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>so just head back there for the more detailed instructions if you need them, or to the the section titled "<A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653#toc-hId--553513390" target="_blank">The Tester service, and making a test request</A>" in the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/2024-07-quot-reverse-apis-quot-sap-developer-challenge/ba-p/13749653" target="_blank">main challenge blog post</A>.</P><P>You'll need to submit a JSON payload like this:</P><DIV class=""><PRE>{
