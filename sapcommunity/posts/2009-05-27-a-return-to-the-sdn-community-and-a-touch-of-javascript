<DIV class="jive-rendered-content"><P>A few days ago, <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">mark.yolton/blog</SPAN> pointed out to me that this Friday, 30th May will mark 6 years since my first SDN blog post "<A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=39213" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SAP/MySQL Partnership</A>", in SDN's <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/weblogs/date/2003/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first month</A>.</P><P>My oh my, how things have changed and progessed! We've seen the rise and rise of <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.sdn.sap.com/weblogs/topic/102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source</A>, the rise and fall of SOA, and the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1794857024" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">incredible improvements</A> in connectedness and social collaboration in SAP events such as Sapphire &amp; TechEd. Excellent. </P><P>Some things haven't changed so much, though. I'm reading SDN in earnest again -- especially the weblog posts. And guess what? The use of frames in SAP portal technology is still hampering basic usability. A particular case in point is bookmarking; I can't usefully or easily bookmark a weblog post without some cut'n'paste gymnastics, because the page title is always the same: "SAP Network Blogs". It should be the entry-specific weblog post title, so you don't end up with 1001 bookmarks that you can't tell apart. </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/x/SdnPageTitleBroken_small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><IMG alt="Before" src="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/x/SdnPageTitleBroken_small.jpg" /></A> </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Not to worry. A couple of <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Greasemonkey</A> Javascript lines later, in the form of <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/qmacro/sdnpagetitle/sdnpagetitle.user.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sdnpagetitle.user.js</A>, (in the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://github.com/qmacro/sdnpagetitle/downloads" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sdnpagetitle github repository</A>) and things are fixed! </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P><A href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/x/SdnPageTitleFixed_small.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><IMG alt="After" src="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/x/SdnPageTitleFixed_small.jpg" /></A> </P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Funny, my last post before this one was <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://blogs.sap.com/?p=41345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OssNoteFix script updated for Greasemonkey 0.6.4 and Firefox 1.5</A> too! </P><P>Share and enjoy, and here's to the next 6 years <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:">ðŸ™‚</span></P></DIV>
