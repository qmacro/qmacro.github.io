It's not a surprise by now that the output from this deploy invocation is also familiar to us - basically the same as what we saw in the console in the SAP Web IDE.<BR />

Of course, we have to remember to make the changes to <CODE>mta.yaml</CODE> again but after that, we're set to go with the new build tool, which completes much more quickly too!<BR />

We note in passing that the script that the SAP Web IDE invokes in this case is <CODE>webide_mbt_build.sh</CODE>, as opposed to the one that was invoked with the deprecated build tool (<CODE>webide_mta_build.sh</CODE>) earlier.<BR />

Deploying this in the same way as before (with <CODE>cf deploy</CODE>) leads to success, too. Lovely!<BR />
<BR />
Hopefully this episode demystified (or "de-magic-ified") what goes on in the build and deploy features of the SAP Web IDE!
