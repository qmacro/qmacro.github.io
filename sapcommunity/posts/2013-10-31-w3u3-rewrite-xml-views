It includes a replacement XML view for each of the views (App, Login, ProductList, ProductDetail, SupplierDetail) and a modified navigation mechanism using the EventBus.</SPAN></P><P></P><P><SPAN>I'll write a blog post on this soon, but for now, as always ... share &amp; enjoy!<BR /></SPAN></P></BODY></HTML>
