I'm off to SAP TechEd this week in Basel. Fantastic. It was a bit of a bumpy start - the online-registration process was a bit of a shambles, and I had to ring up to complete the transaction as the webpage (javascript?) was broken. Not a good advert for web-based commerce, is it? Anyway, after 3&nbsp; (!)separate phone calls to the registration company I finally got the details I needed, and I'm off on the train via Koeln tomorrow down to Basel.<BR />
<BR />
As an attendee of other technical events, for example O'Reilly's <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2003/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source Convention</A>, I've become used to expecting wireless 'net access. One&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the great things about attending conferences and meeting like-minded people&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is that there's a ton of social interaction and collaboration that goes on in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parallel to the actual sessions, presentations and stalls.<BR />
<BR />
With that in mind, and presuming that there will be 'net access, I've set&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up an IRC channel '#teched' on gnu.pipetree.com (port 6667) - the IRC server&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is password protected - specify 'teched' as the password when you connect. There&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can log on and discuss aspects of SAP technology as presented and discussed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the sessions and presentations. The collaboration is facilitated by that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; killer-app of IRC, the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://usefulinc.com/chump/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daily&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chump bot</A>. It sits in an IRC channel and helps you collate links and comments&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into a dynamic weblog. For more information, see the Chump's documentation (at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the link above). An example of the Chump at work can be seen at <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RDF Interest Group's collective blog</A>.<BR />
<BR />
So if you're interested in finding a place to chat about things and log things of interest with comments, you're welcome to the #teched channel and the use of the Chump bot.<BR />
<BR />
Any questions, just <A class="jive-link-email-small" href="mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ask</A>!<BR />
