<DIV class="jive-rendered-content"><P>SAP TechEd 2013 is fast approaching, and the excitement is building. Interested in SAPUI5 (you're reading this blog post in the <A class="jive-link-community-small" href="http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAPUI5 Developer Center</A> space on SCN already!), you're looking to see what sessions to attend. And you're looking to build and improve your skills, and perhaps find out more about SAP Fiori.</P><P></P><P>Have I got the session for you!</P><P></P><P><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt"><STRONG>CD168 "</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt"><STRONG>Building SAP Fiori-like UIs with SAPUI5" - </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN style="font-size: 12pt"><STRONG>2hr Hands-On</STRONG></SPAN></P><P></P><P><SPAN>What is Fiori? Well, from the </SPAN><A class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://experience.sap.com/fiori" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://experience.sap.com/fiori</A><SPAN> site, this is a good start: </SPAN></P><BLOCKQUOTE class="jive-quote"><BR />

</BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><P>What is Fiori built upon? You guessed it, SAPUI5. And specifically, the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sap.m</A> library (and a sprinkling of other more general controls). Fiori is part application set, part responsive design, part look and feel, and part state-of-mind. What makes a Fiori app? Well, amongst other things, it's the use of certain controls and design to achieve the consistent experience you might have already come to expect from Wave 1, which delivered the 25 ESS/MSS apps. Wave 2 is coming soon, and set to deliver many many more apps across a broader functional range.</P><P></P><P>I have the tremendous privilege of working with the SAPUI5 teams in Walldorf currently and know first hand the massive effort (love, intelligence and dedication) that has gone into building the foundation for Fiori. And for me as a developer, it's very important to understand what's going on under the Fiori hood, not only for building new apps but for supporting my customers.</P><P></P><P>So enter CD168, a two-hour hands-on session at SAP TechEd titled "Building SAP Fiori-like UIs with SAPUI5". If you want to find out how to build SAPUI5 apps with a Fiori flavour, to get a feel for what controls to use and how to use them, then you should seriously consider attending.</P><P></P><P>An intensive hands-on set of an introductory walkthrough of the developer toolset and environment, and then a series of ten exercises taking you from this to this:</P><P><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2013/10/cd168_before_and_after_292636.jpg" width="620" /></P><P></P><P>where along the way you learn about <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/Introduction.1.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">databinding</A>, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/I18NinAppDev.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">localisation</A>, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/ResourceModel.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">resource models</A>, XML-based views, formatter functions, best practices for application design &amp; build and controls such as the responsive <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/docs/api/symbols/sap.m.SplitApp.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SplitApp</A>, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/docs/api/symbols/sap.m.ObjectHeader.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ObjectHeader</A> &amp; <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/docs/api/symbols/sap.m.ObjectListItem.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ObjectListItem</A>, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.IconTabBar.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IconTabBar</A>, <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.SearchField.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SearchField</A> and others.</P><P></P><P>The session is available at SAP TechEd Las Vegas, and also in Amsterdam where along with esteemed SAP colleagues, I am honoured to be co-presenting.</P><P></P><P>If I had not had the chance to contribute to the session materials and co-present, I would certainly have this session at the top of my must-attend list.</P><P></P><P>What about you?
