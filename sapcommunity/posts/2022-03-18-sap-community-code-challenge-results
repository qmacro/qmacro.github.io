<EM>We had some great entries for the SAP Community Code Challenge, here's a quick overview and details on what's next.</EM><BR />
<BR />
We <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/14/sap-community-code-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched the SAP Community Code Challenge</A> a month ago, and we've had some great entries and conversations between then and now, in the <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/coffee-corner/sap-community-code-challenge-learn-share-and-discuss/m-p/2959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Community Groups discussion thread</A>.<BR />
<BR />
As the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/14/sap-community-code-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch blog post</A> explained, this challenge was intended to be loose, friendly and fun, and really it's a bit of a learning opportunity "in disguise". Anyone who has coded solutions to exercises on platforms like <A href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Project Euler</A>&nbsp;or <A href="https://exercism.org/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Exercism</A> (to name just a couple) will know what we mean here!<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-960147436">A new badge!</H2><BR />
We decided to create a new SAP Community badge to award to the participants of this challenge. Fittingly, it reflects the "Pixel Person" theme that ran through the <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/coffee-corner/sap-community-code-challenge-learn-share-and-discuss/m-p/2959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussion thread</A>. Everyone who participated will receive this badge. In fact, if you've not yet had the chance to participate, read on to the end for a special offer.<BR />

<H2 id="toc-hId-763633931">Challenge aspects</H2><BR />
The starter project, created for the challenge by <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">thomas.jung</SPAN>, contained many technical components that came together to become a great little image editing app. It's still available of course, as a reference in the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Samples</A> organisation on GitHub, in the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-community-code-challenge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sap-community-code-challenge repository</A>. In it, you'll find nuggets of information across these different technical areas:<BR />
<UL><BR />
 	<LI>Web app architecture: the project is a web app consisting of a frontend and a backend</LI><BR />
 	<LI>Node.js: the backend is a Node.js based mechanism, using Express to respond to incoming HTTP requests from the frontend, and serving those requests with JavaScript based responders</LI><BR />
 	<LI>Fiori: the frontend part of the app embraces the Fiori design language, and also shows you how to create and use a local Fiori launchpad with a tile to launch the app itself</LI><BR />
 	<LI>UI5: while Fiori is the UX, the UI is provided by UI5, and in particular, the app showcases the <A href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/entity/sap.suite.ui.commons.imageeditor/sample/sap.suite.ui.commons.sample.ImageEditorContainer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">UI5 image editor</A> component</LI><BR />
 	<LI>The project also contains definitions for a container based runtime that can be used with Docker, and specifically within a <A href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">VS Code devcontainer scenario</A> (for more information on dev containers, you may like the three-part blog post series <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/27/boosting-tutorial-ux-with-dev-containers-part-1-challenge-and-base-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boosting tutorial UX with dev containers</A>)</LI><BR />
</UL><BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-567120426">Contributions</H2><BR />
There were some great contributions; here is a quick overview:<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">nicolai.geburek</SPAN> added another image with which to enhance your profile picture, and also added a randomise feature.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">btc.nils.lutz</SPAN> contributed a whole load of feature and enhancements, not only bringing <A href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TypeScript</A> to the table (this is JavaScript with syntax for types) but also switching the package manager, bringing in a mechanism for code formatting, and much more.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">vinay.s6</SPAN> implemented the app using <A href="https://www.appgyver.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AppGyver</A> which was a fascinating angle, especially to see the function flow that he shared.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">daniel.wroblewski</SPAN> looked at translations and internationalisation (also known as i18n), and it was great to see Daniel use his native knowledge to add support for Hebrew, which is a right-to-left (RTL) language which of course is <A href="https://qmacro.org/2015/07/16/multi-language-support-out-of-the-box-ui5-s-pedigree/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">supported out of the box with UI5</A>. He also added a chatbot feature!<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">alexfrank</SPAN> added a feature to automatically import the existing profile picture based on the input of one's SAP Community name.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">huseyin.dereli</SPAN> added a feature which facilitates the import of one's GitHub profile picture, which nicely balances Alex's contribution.<BR />
<BR />
<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">gabortoth05</SPAN> did some fascinating work to build his own control, inheriting from the UI5 image editor control, and added a new control to handle image layers. Not only that, he also added extra filters.<BR />
<BR />
Moreover, lots of folks, including <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">craig.cmehil</SPAN>, <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">jerry.janda</SPAN> and <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">l_stodal</SPAN> got the project up and running and used it to enhance their profile picture. Just getting the project up and running is a great step forward, and all part of the learning experience.<BR />
<BR />
Everyone listed here will receive the badge, congratulations to everyone who took part!<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-370606921">What's next</H2><BR />
As a quick summary, here are the things to look out for next:<BR />
<UL><BR />
