<BR />
Marius is going to show us the SAP Business Application Studio, and we start with a brief look at a couple of blog posts: <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/15/showcasing-sap-business-application-studio-the-next-generation-of-sap-web-ide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Showcasing: SAP Business Application Studio (the next generation of SAP Web IDE)</A> by <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">nirm.kol</SPAN> and indeed one of Marius's own posts, from his Cloud Foundry Fun series - <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/10/30/cloudfoundryfun-9-develop-with-the-sap-business-application-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#CloudFoundryFun #9 â€“ Develop with the SAP Business Application Studio</A>.<BR />

<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h11m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:11:00</A> There's a tutorial group in our <A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorial-navigator.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tutorial Navigator</A> that Marius highlights, that relates to what we're going to build: <A href="https://developers.sap.com/group.cp-frontend-ui5-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a Web Front End with SAPUI5 in Web IDE</A>.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h11m50s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:11:50</A> Looking at Marius's Northwind destination definition, which is at the subaccount level.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h13m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:13:00</A> In our first touch point with the Business Application Studio we see for the first time the concept of "Dev Spaces". Each Dev Space comes with all the tools you need to develop your solution (such as plugins, cli tools, and so on).<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h15m30s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:15:30</A> Seeing the UI for the first time, it looks very familiar - based on, and compatible with, VS Code. Very nice!<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h16m15s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:16:15</A> Discussing the "Format on Save" feature of the IDE, which on the whole I think is a very good thing.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h17m40s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:17:40</A> Using the command line to install some software, specifically Marius's <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/02/05/introducing-the-easy-ui5-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UI5 generator</A>:<BR />
<PRE><CODE>npm i generator-easy-ui5</CODE></PRE><BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h19m15s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:19:15</A> The beauty of the Business Application Studio is (for me) that it gives each developer a full, working environment, in the cloud. One of the challenges we see when running CodeJams is the requirement to set up a development environment locally, especially on Windows devices. These challenges are completely neutralised in this context.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h21m30s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:21:30</A> Checking what version of Node.js is automatically available, we see that it's the LTS version of Node.js 10. That's good.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h22m15s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:22:15</A> Using the IDE's Command Palette to invoke a Yeoman (<CODE>yo</CODE>) command, where we see that the palette is used as a generic UI for input and selection, which looks really nice.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h24m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:24:00</A> Choosing the view type for the UI5 project, and we joke about choosing JavaScript views (this did remind me of an old blog post I wrote comparing the different view types in UI5 (XML, HTML, JavaScript and JSON), but I can't seem to find where that got to - if you know, or have a link, please let me know!).<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h25m50s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:25:50</A> Looking at the <CODE>xs-app.json</CODE> file in the App Router, where we define a mapping to the Northwind destination, and discussing the challenges of ensuring the route definitions are in the right order so that URLs are appropriately matched ... and whether the editor should do something to help us here.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h28m50s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:28:50</A> Looking at how the App Router can be started from a local directory.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h29m20s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:29:20</A> Comparing the destination definitions in Neo and Cloud Foundry (CF), and how they're very similar, but that in CF the destination is created as an instance of the Destination service (and that, as we see shortly after this, the application needs to be bound to this instance).<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h30m30s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:30:30</A> Connecting to and authenticating with CF, and selecting the organisation and space; following this we can also immediately use the command line <CODE>cf</CODE> CLI client (or the Command Palette equivalents).<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h31m25s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:31:25</A> Creating a new service instance, using the Command Palette - very comfortable and convenient!<BR />

<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h35m30s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:35:30</A> Highlighting <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">graham.robinson</SPAN> observation that the Business Application Studio is much more "target aware", in that we can carry out deployment target activities without having to jump out to other tools.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h35m50s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:35:50</A> Checking the success of the service binding, by looking at the <CODE>.env</CODE> file in the <CODE>dist/</CODE> directory (and we then move <CODE>.env</CODE> into the <CODE>approuter/</CODE> directory for it to be accessed and used.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h36m50s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:36:50</A> Even more goodness - on startup we see that the Business Application Studio offers a port forwarding facility so that an application started up and listening in the context of the development space (in the cloud, but "pseudo-local" to the developer in the IDE) can be accessed from a regular workstation-local web browser.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h39m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:39:00</A> Following a question on the <CODE>mbt</CODE> tool (the cloud MTA Build Tool), we note that the tool is now no longer in beta, and is in fact accessible from <A class="uri" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mbt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/mbt</A>.

<BR />
In fact, online IDEs and editors abound - we also mention the <A href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-google-cloud-shels-new-code-editor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">code editor available in Google Cloud Shell</A>, <A href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gitpod</A>, a one-click online IDE for GitHub and of course <A href="https://repl.it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">repl.it</A>.<BR />

<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h51m00s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:51:00</A> Reminiscing about the early days of UI5 - the first version of UI5 I played with (when it was first released publicly) was 1.2.0 (a beta version) - I wrote about it in a post in 2012: <A href="https://www.bluefinsolutions.com/insights/dj-adams/january-2014/sapui5-the-future-direction-of-sap-ui-developmen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAPUI5 - The Future direction of SAP UI Development?</A>, and indeed it seems a long time ago already since we were celebrating the milestone release of 1.30 with the series of articles under the theme "<A href="https://qmacro.org/2015/07/04/30-days-of-ui5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">30 Days of UI5</A>".<BR />

<PRE><CODE>npm run deploy</CODE></PRE><BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h54m35s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:54:35</A> Sorting out a quick demo-based issue, by using <CODE>npx</CODE> to more specifically point to the <CODE>mbt</CODE> tool so that the build runs correctly.<BR />
<BR />
And with a quick <CODE>cf deploy</CODE> we're off to CF! While that happens, Marius takes us on a brief tour of the plugins in his Business Application Studio instance.<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h57m20s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:57:20</A> Marius shows an example of the work that the teams have been doing, to bring over the extensions from SAP Web IDE so that they can be used in the SAP Business Application Studio. The example here is the Layout Editor for XML Views in UI5. Very nice!<BR />
<BR />
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG4iVredIwc&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQAIntm7MkNk78ysDm3Ua8t0&amp;t=00h58m20s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">00:58:20</A> And to round this episode off, Marius loads the actual deployed application in his browser, served from CF. Not only that, but he shows a use of command line tools and pipelining to get a clickable URL:<BR />
<PRE><CODE>echo "https://"$(cf apps | grep started | awk '{print $6}')</CODE></PRE><BR />
... which is the perfect way to end this episode and this annotations blog post (remember - #<A href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheFutureIsTerminal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TheFutureIsTerminal</A>!). Thanks to Marius for this great session, and to you all for your continued support and following of <A href="https://bit.ly/handsonsapdev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hands-on SAP dev with qmacro</A>!
