<EM>Note: While this blog post was originally published in 2018, it's been <STRONG>updated for 2020 and now also for 2021</STRONG>&nbsp;thanks to great help and input from the excellent <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">iwona.hahn</SPAN>. Take a few mins to have a fresh look through, as you'll find that many items have been updated. And don't forget to "<A href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Share_and_Enjoy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">share &amp; enjoy</A>"!</EM><BR />
<BR />
There's been a lot of activity and interest around CAP for SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), not least during the last couple of years of SAP TechEd events, and also as it <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2019/11/06/cap-is-important-because-its-not-important/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coalesces into a fundamental technology in the cloud development stack</A>. I thought it would be useful to provide an overview of the key resources, for folks who are wondering how to get started.<BR />
<BR />
Briefly, CAP for SAP BTP is a framework of tools, languages and libraries, some from SAP, some open source. With these tools, languages and libraries you can efficiently and rapidly build enterprise services and applications in a full-stack development approach. It guides you along a golden path of best practices, allowing you to focus on your domain while relieving you from tedious technical tasks.<BR />
<BR />
You can find core documentation for CAP in <A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">capire</A>.<BR />

Begin with the <A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Getting Started</A> section, as that will take you through the basics as well as detailing some best practices and reference material.<BR />
<BR />

<STRONG>SAP Developer Center&nbsp;</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
In the <A href="https://developers.sap.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Developer Center</A>, there are missions, tutorial groups and tutorials.<BR />
<BR />
In the beginner-level mission "<A href="https://developers.sap.com/mission.scp-3-odata.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take a Deep Dive into OData</A>" there's a tutorial group "<A href="https://developers.sap.com/group.scp-8-odata-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build Your First OData-based Backend Service</A>" which gives you a high level taster.<BR />

CAP has proved to have been a popular topic in the sessions and in the corridors at SAP TechEd over the last couple of years.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>2019</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
There was an array of sessions at SAP TechEd Barcelona - check out the <A href="https://sessioncatalog.sapevents.com/go/agendabuilder.sessions/?l=221&amp;locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Agenda Builder</A>&nbsp;to find out more.<BR />

<BR />
There is a great session from <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">christian.georgi</SPAN> <A href="https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555751912001uqld" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Cloud Application Programming Model Evolution – What’s New [DEV103]</A> which is a lecture session with all the news on both the Node.js and Java runtimes.<BR />
<BR />
&nbsp;<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Tools</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
If you have a look at the exercises for CNA376 you'll see they're for a Node.js (JavaScript) runtime. As well as tools and features for the Application Programming Model being available in the SAP Web IDE Full-Stack, there's also an extension for Visual Studio Code.<BR />
<BR />
Read more about this <STRONG>SAP CDS Language Support</STRONG> extension in <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">joerg.mann</SPAN>'s post "<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/10/09/introducing-core-data-services-cds-for-vs-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing Core Data &amp; Services (CDS) for VS Code</A>" and grab it from the <A href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPSE.vscode-cds#overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Marketplace</A> - find out more in the <A href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/tools#add-cds-editor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tools section</A> of the CAP documentation.<BR />

That's what comes to mind to me this evening - if there's anything else (please let me know) I'll add it to this post as and when it appears or occurs to me.<BR />
