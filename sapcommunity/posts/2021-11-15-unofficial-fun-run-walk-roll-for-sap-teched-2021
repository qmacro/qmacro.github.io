<EM>Let's get active together again for SAP TechEd 2021 by walking, running or rolling a 5K route and sharing that experience.</EM><BR />
<BR />
Last year <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">phil.cooley</SPAN> and I came up with the idea for getting some fresh air and enjoying a bit of exercise together during SAP TechEd. We wrote about it in the post <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/01/utfrw-unofficial-teched-fun-run-walk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTFRW - Unofficial TechEd Fun Run / Walk</A>. It's that time of year again - SAP TechEd week is now upon us for 2021 - so let's get into action once more!<BR />
<BR />
Phil and I have set up <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-teched-discussions/utfrw-unofficial-teched-fun-run-walk-roll-share-your-pics/m-p/1047#M127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new topic</A> in the SAP TechEd discussion group and all you need to do is cover a 5K distance any way you can and share a picture from it.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Share your pics here in this topic ☞ <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-teched-discussions/utfrw-unofficial-teched-fun-run-walk-roll-share-your-pics/m-p/1047#M127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTFRW - Unofficial TechEd Fun Run / Walk / Roll - Share Your Pics!</A></STRONG><BR />
<BR />
There are no prizes, it's just for fun.<BR />
<BR />
So get your "active" on, get out there and share a picture of yourself or where you've been.<BR />
<BR />
As we said last time, this is completely unofficial and just a way of us sharing our own personal experiences – nothing more than that. Take care, have fun, and see you in the discussion!<BR />
