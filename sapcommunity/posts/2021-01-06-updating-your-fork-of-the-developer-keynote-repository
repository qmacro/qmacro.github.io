<EM>If you've forked the SAP TechEd Developer Keynote repository on GitHub recently, there have been some additions and improvements. This post shows you how you can update your fork so that it contains all the new material.</EM><BR />
<BR />
If you didn't see the Developer Keynote at SAP TechEd last month, go over to <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/19/sap-teched-developer-keynote-dk100-the-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP TechEd Developer Keynote DK100 â€“ The Story</A> and watch it. Hopefully you'll find it fun, interesting and inspiring. All the code and configuration for everything you saw in that keynote is in a repository on GitHub:<BR />
<BR />

<BR />
We'll be digging into this repository on the upcoming <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q-84fxe0Jg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Hands-on SAP Dev live stream episode</A> which is now next week <STRONG>Fri 15 Jan at 0800 GMT</STRONG> - set a reminder and join us!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Background</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
We've been <A href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1337488442159222785" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">encouraging</A> you to fork this repository, i.e. create your own copy of it.<BR />
<BR />
Why have we been doing that? Well, there's a lot of material in that repository, and we want to help you get the most out of it, with your own copy.<BR />
<BR />
But if you'd just cloned it to a local environment, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the GitHub Actions-based workflow that is part of the repository; this workflow builds and publishes Docker images (for some of the components) to a registry associated with your own GitHub repository ... and these images can then be pulled into the Kyma runtime.<BR />
<BR />
For this to work, you need to run the workflow in your own repository on GitHub, not in the SAP-samples one.<BR />
<BR />
In this blog post, we'll be using me as an example - I forked the repo last month too, to <A href="https://github.com/qmacro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my "qmacro" GitHub account</A>. So where you see "qmacro", substitute your own GitHub user.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Forking and cloning</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the terms "fork" and "clone" in this context, here's a very brief explanation:<BR />
<BR />
"fork" - take a complete copy of a repository; this makes most sense in a GitHub context, where you may want to start working on something in your own account, based on something in another account. You may even plan to make changes and offer those changes to the owner of the original repository that you forked (via a "pull request").<BR />
<BR />
"clone" - this is also taking a copy of a repository's contents, but is a more a git thing (the tool / protocol) than a GitHub thing (the developer collaboration website). It's usually for bringing a copy of a repository to a development environment that's local to you, so you can work on it.<BR />
<BR />
There are relationships between repositories; these are referred to using the term "remote". Conventionally, the relation between a forked repository, and where it was forked from, is expressed with a remote called "upstream" (the forked repository points to its source via this remote). Similarly, the relation that a cloned repository has with where it was cloned from is expressed with a remote called "origin".<BR />
<BR />
Here's what those relationships look like, in the context of:<BR />
<UL><BR />
 	<LI>our <STRONG>SAP-samples</STRONG> based Developer Keynote repository</LI><BR />
 	<LI>a fork of that repository to my <STRONG>qmacro</STRONG>&nbsp;account</LI><BR />
 	<LI>a clone of that forked repository to a development environment</LI><BR />
</UL><BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/fork-clone-1.gif" /></P><BR />
<STRONG>A quick check before we update</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
Before we proceed, let's take a quick look at the current situation.<BR />
<BR />
I forked the repository last month, to my "qmacro" GitHub account. This is what my forked repository looks like right now:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-16.07.31.png" /></P><BR />
Notice the last update showing here was 29 days ago (basically, from just before I made the fork).<BR />
<BR />
But if we look at the source of the fork, i.e. the original Developer Keynote repository at <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote</A>, this is what it's showing right now:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-16.08.52.png" /></P><BR />
&nbsp;<BR />
<BR />
Notice that the last update here was only a few minutes ago (yes, it was me, updating the original repository - that's not confusing, right? ðŸ¤ª); also notice that the content is different - there's a new ".github/workflows/" directory, for example.<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Updating the fork</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
Now that we're clear on forks, clones and the relationship between them, and know that there is indeed content that we're missing in our "qmacro" fork, it's time to use those "remote" relationships, with a few git command invocations, to bring the fork up to date.<BR />
<BR />
Here's what we're going to do: Clone the "qmacro" repository to a local environment, then add the "upstream" remote relationship pointing to the original source. Next,&nbsp;pull the "main" branch from that "upstream" remote into the clone to bring down all the updates, and finally push the now-merged updates in the clone to the "origin" of the clone (i.e. the repository in the "qmacro" GitHub account).<BR />
<BR />
Here goes!<BR />
<BR />
<EM>Clone the "qmacro" repository to a local environment:</EM><BR />
<PRE class="language-abap"><CODE>; git clone <A href="https://github.com/qmacro/teched2020-developer-keynote.git" target="test_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/qmacro/teched2020-developer-keynote.git</A><BR />

<EM>Pull the "main" branch from that "upstream" remote into the clone, to bring down all the updates (lots of lines redacted for brevity):</EM><BR />

   fc07e54..bc0aa2f  main -&gt; main</CODE></PRE><BR />
That's it! We've effectively pulled down updates from the original repository (top left in the diagram), to our clone in the development environment (bottom middle in the diagram), and then pushed those merged updates up to the origin of our clone, i.e. the repository on GitHub that we'd created as a fork (top right in the diagram).<BR />
<BR />
Now, in GitHub, the repository in the "qmacro" account looks like this:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-16.52.31.png" /></P><BR />
All nice and up to date!<BR />
<BR />
<STRONG>Wrapping up</STRONG><BR />
<BR />
Of course, there's another brute force way of "updating" your fork - and that is to simply delete it and re-do the fork. But that approach is far too blunt, would cause any changes you'd made to your fork be lost, and doesn't teach us anything <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:">ðŸ™‚</span><BR />
<BR />
I've put together a script containing the commands used here, and have pushed that to the Developer Keynote repository too - it's <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/blob/main/forkupdateutils/2-clone-and-update" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2-clone-and-update</A>. Have a look and feel free to play around. If you're there, have a look at <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/blob/main/forkupdateutils/1-setup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">1-setup</A> - can you tell what I wrote it for? <span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":slightly_smiling_face:">ðŸ™‚</span><BR />
<BR />
We'll be covering some of this on <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q-84fxe0Jg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">next week's Hands-on SAP Dev live stream episode</A> - I hope to see you there!<BR />
