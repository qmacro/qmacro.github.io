Yesterday I ran a CodeJam in Brescia, Italy, on the topic of service integration with CAP, the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model. Here's a quick overview, with plenty of pictures.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-1650155981">Working on the content</H2><P>This wasn't the first instance of a CodeJam on this topic; the inaugural outing of the content took place in Utrecht, NL in February (see<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://localhost:8000/blog/posts/2023/02/11/sap-codejam-on-service-integration-with-cap-in-utrecht/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">SAP CodeJam on Service Integration with CAP in Utrecht</A>) so I was generally happy with how the content flowed. Nevertheless, I had been working on it recently, running up to this event:</P><P><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="commits" style="width: 999px;"><img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/36275i73561FC8FE1F0E34/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999" role="button" title="commits" alt="commits" /></span></P><P>Looks like at least one of my Developer Advocate colleagues Antonio<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://fedi.ajmaradiaga.com/@antonio/110395822934061159" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">has been putting work in on his CodeJam content this week</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>too!</P><BLOCKQUOTE><P>If you want to find out more about the CodeJams that we offer, I recommend you read this post from Tom Jung:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam-blog-posts/so-you-want-to-host-a-codejam-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/221415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So, You Want to Host a CodeJam!

In doing so, we take a route that introduces us to various CAP server features, cds commands, in-process and external mocking, initial data supply, and take a look at how to extend both services and entities.</P><P>Moreover, on that route, we learn about the cds environment, profiles, port control, and custom vs built-in resolutions of OData operation responses. Ultimately we bind in a real remote external service and have it work in harmony with our own local service.</P><P>Not only that, but we also dig deep into the philosophy and practicality of how, where and why we make changes and extensions in the places we do. Think of it as dipping into the essential topic of "keep the core clean" for CDS based services and mashups.</P><P>And of course, all the way through, we work through deliberate errors that are there for us to learn from and have fun with.</P><P>If this sounds like something you would like to experience, check out<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam-blog-posts/so-you-want-to-host-a-codejam-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/221415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom's post that I mentioned earlier</A>.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-1774273064">After the event</H2><P>I headed back to Milan that same Friday evening to be closer to Malpensa airport for my flight, which is today (I'm writing this on Saturday).
