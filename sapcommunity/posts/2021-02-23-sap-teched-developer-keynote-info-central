You can watch a replay of the actual Developer Keynote on the <A href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sapdevs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Developers channel</A> on YouTube:<BR />

The video is also <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsHFkOEDUE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">available</A> on the <A href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJdXZAAOsNuPBpLa50XUxQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP TechEd channel</A> on YouTube.<BR />
<H1 id="toc-hId-415037287"><A name="the-accompanying-repository" target="_blank"></A>The accompanying repository</H1><BR />
All the code and configuration for all the components you saw in the keynote are available for you to download, try out and learn from. They're in the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">teched2020-developer-keynote</A> repository, in the SAP-samples organisation on GitHub.<BR />
<BR />
This is a living collection of code, configuration and - perhaps most importantly - rich documentation, which we're adding to even now.<BR />
<BR />
In the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote#download-and-installation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Download and installation section</A> of this repository's main README, we encourage you to fork the repository, and give reasons why. We've provided instructions on how to <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/06/updating-your-developer-keynote-repo-fork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update your fork of the Developer Keynote repository</A> too.<BR />
<BR />

<H2 id="toc-hId-347606501"><A name="component-by-component" target="_blank"></A>Component by component</H2><BR />
Each component that you saw in the video and presented on the now-famous whiteboard, is described with instructions as to how to get it up and running in various runtimes.<BR />

<BR />
For example, if you take a look at the repository content for the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/tree/main/s4hana/sandbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SANDBOX component</A>, you'll see that there's a wealth of rich information and instructions for getting it running on multiple platforms, sometimes describing multiple approaches. This is for when you want to really dive in and enjoy some related learning at the same time.<BR />

Moreover, we have put together a guided <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/blob/main/quickstart.md" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Quick start</A> section which guides you through a recommended order in which to enjoy the component setup, from the SAP Enterprise Messaging service based message bus, all the way through the different components that you saw interacting together in the developer keynote itself.<BR />

If you're unsure of what development environment to use, we've included detailed instructions for you to be able to use the SAP Business Application Studio. This is especially useful if you don't want to or are unable to install some of the tools required. In <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/tree/main/usingappstudio" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Using the SAP Business Application Studio</A> we guide you through setting up a dev space with extra tools, and also describe how we are going to perform the Docker related activities using the power of <A href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GitHub Actions</A>.<BR />
<H1 id="toc-hId--371016733"><A name="a-hands-on-sap-dev-series" target="_blank"></A>A Hands-on SAP Dev series</H1><BR />
