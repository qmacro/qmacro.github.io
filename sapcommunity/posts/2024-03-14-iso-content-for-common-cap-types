<P>There's an NPM package that provides default content based on the ISO specifications for CAP common types for countries, languages, currencies and timezones. In this post I explore what that package is and how it works. The post is quite long, mostly because I fell down a rabbit hole and was stuck there for quite a while. Hopefully though it's something you might enjoy.
