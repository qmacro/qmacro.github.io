<H2 id="toc-hId-960200450">Review and looking ahead</H2><BR />
Each topic has a Developer Advocate host, and I spoke with each of them to find out what happened this week, and more importantly what's in store for us next week. Let's take a look!<BR />
<H3 id="toc-hId-892769664">ðŸŸ¢ ABAP hosted by Mamikee Kanneh</H3><BR />
<P style="font-weight: 400">In the first week of Devtoberfest, on the ABAP day (Monday) we went over a couple of introduction topics in ABAP. We kicked off with the day by learning the basics of object-oriented design in the ABAP language with Thomas Jung. We also discussed some of the common design patterns that are most often used in ABAP. From the factory pattern to dependency injection, we looked at different patterns implemented in ABAP. After that session, we got our Eclipse ADT installed with the help of Mamikee Kanneh and Thomas Jung. We also got a brief overview of what ABAP is and how to get started. The session included a live walk-through to help you install your ADT and create your first ABAP console application.</P><BR />
<P style="font-weight: 400">For next week, we have a jet packed group sessions on ABAP day (Monday):</P><BR />
<P style="font-weight: 400">In <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/developer-extensibility-and-business-events-with-rap-on-sap-s/ec-p/8998#M33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Extensibility and Business Events with RAP on SAP S/4HANA Cloud</A> you will learn about the newly added RAP extensibility options and the easy exposure of business events in RAP-based applications.</P><BR />
In <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/dealing-with-legacy-code-and-transactional-consistency-in-rap/ec-p/9000#M35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dealing with Legacy Code and Transactional Consistency in RAP</A>, we'll have a discussion on this topic, answering questions such as "which legacy ABAP code can be reused in RAP?" and "what must developers do to ensure the transactional consistency of the SAP Logical Work of Unit (LUW) when working with RAP?"<BR />
<P style="font-weight: 400">Ever heard of Exercism? Exercism is an online, open-source, free coding platform that offers code practice and mentorship on 50+ different programming languages. And now ABAP is available too! Join the session <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibtCcww1m2k&amp;list=PL6RpkC85SLQDHz97qsNTNAE2jnUKj8X5d&amp;index=27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ABAP on Exercism?

In the first week of Devtoberfest we covered a couple of very relevant topics in the world of frontend development: <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/how-to-make-state-management-work-for-you-with-redux-and-redux/ec-p/9453#M56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Make State Management Work for You with Redux and Redux Toolkit</A> and <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/how-to-simplify-your-data-fetching-life-with-rtk-query/ec-p/9011#M41'" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to simplify your data fetching life with RTK Query</A>.<BR />
<BR />
Next week we have another couple of very interesting topics for you, on SAP BTP and SAP Fiori. First, there's <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/configuring-btp-cross-account-and-cross-region-destinations-for/ec-p/9410#M54" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configuring BTP Cross-Account and Cross-Region Destinations For Use in UI Tooling</A> showcasing the additional steps necessary to enable a BTP Destination for usage across Global Accounts or between different regions. Then we take a look at open source development tools and SAP Fiori with <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/outside-the-lines-sap-fiori-elements-flexible-programming-model/ec-p/8831#M1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outside the lines: SAP Fiori elements flexible programming model</A>.<BR />
<H3 id="toc-hId-499742654"><span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":blue_circle:">ðŸ”µ</span> Data and Analytics hosted by Witalij Rudnicki</H3><BR />
The Data and Analytics track kicked off with the focus on the Machine Learning capabilities embedded into SAP HANA and SAP Data Warehouse Cloud, in the session <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/build-your-machine-learning-scenario-for-your-sap-hana-cloud/ec-p/9071#M45" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build your Machine Learning Scenario for your SAP HANA Cloud application from Python</A>. Questions asked by participants showed that there is a lot of interest in Machine Learning and â€“ even broader â€“ in Artificial Intelligence in the SAP community. We also had a great session on <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/machine-learning-engines-embedded-in-sap-data-warehouse-cloud/ec-p/9108#M46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning engines embedded in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</A>.<BR />
<BR />
In week 2 we will shift the focus to topics important for customers of SAP Analytics Cloud: <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/bi-directional-integration-between-sap-data-warehouse-cloud-and/ec-p/9392#M52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bi-directional integration with SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</A> and <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/enhancing-analytic-application-functionality-with-simple/ec-p/9601#M57" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing Analytic Application functionality with simple scripting</A>.<BR />
<H3 id="toc-hId-303229149"><span class="lia-unicode-emoji" title=":red_circle:">ðŸ”´</span> Low and No Code Tooling hosted by Daniel Wroblewski</H3><BR />
What a start to this topic, with five sessions on low and no code tooling! There was so much to cover, from an helpful overview of the whole topic in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/why-am-i-hearing-so-much-about-low-code-and-no-code/ec-p/8951#M11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Am I Hearing So Much About Low-Code and No-Code?</A>, followed directly by how SAP Business Application Studio and CI/CD can help, in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/control-the-entire-app-development-lifecycle-with-sap-business/ec-p/8954#M13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Control the Entire App Development Lifecycle with SAP Business Application Studio</A>. Then we looked at how you can quickly get started with zero installation needed, in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/using-visual-tools-to-create-a-mobile-application/ec-p/8956#M15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Visual Tools to Create a Mobile Application</A>. With the nominal "keynote" session for this topic/week, we then had <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/the-best-of-both-worlds-visual-tools-but-still-full-control-of/ec-p/8953#M12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best of Both Worlds: Visual Tools but Still Full Control of Your Code</A>, looking deeper into SAP Business Application Studio's tool set. And we rounded off this topic day with some lovely graphics in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/easily-add-analytical-charts-to-your-sap-fiori-app/ec-p/8955#M14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easily Add Analytical Charts to Your SAP Fiori App</A>.<BR />
<BR />
Next week we have even more sessions for you - far too many to list here (<A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/eb-p/devtoberfest-events?filter=includeUpcoming,labels&amp;depth=0&amp;label_texts=Low-Code%20No-Code&amp;byPassHideMessagesFromListFilter=true&amp;sort_by=occasionStartTime&amp;include_upcoming=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head over to this filtered view to see them all</A>), but in summary, we'll be covering the SAP AppGyver topic in a LOT of detail, going deep and wide. Don't miss it!<BR />
<H3 id="toc-hId-106715644">ðŸŸ  Cloud Native Development hosted by Kevin Muessig</H3><BR />
For the Cloud Native day of Devtoberfest, in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/cloud-native-opening-with-kevin-amp-josh/ec-p/8866#M3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Native Opening with Kevin &amp; Josh</A>, we got a great overview of the upcoming cloud native sessions and chatted about interesting content SAP is providing to get into the Cloud Native topic with a hard focus on the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime.<BR />
<BR />
In the session <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/what-even-is-cloud-native-and-the-basics-of-kubernetes/ec-p/8868#M4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What even is Cloud Native and the Basics of Kubernetes</A> Kevin introduced the attendees of Devtoberfest to the history of Kubernetes and the concepts behind Cloud Native. He also gave a brief overview of the Kubernetes architecture and why this technology is so relevant today. Bridging to the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime he also explained SAPâ€™s fully managed Kubernetes runtime.<BR />
<BR />
Next week we have super important topics covered, such as <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/day-2-operations-with-the-sap-btp-kyma-runtime-part-1/ec-p/8872#M6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Day-2 Operations with the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime</A> and <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/devtoberfest/sap-hana-cloud-from-the-sap-btp-kyma-runtime/ec-p/8869#M5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP HANA Cloud from the SAP BTP, Kyma runtime</A>.<BR />
