We also talk about the architecture and startup of a very simple app.</SPAN></P><P></P><P><SPAN>Questions covered:</SPAN></P><P><SPAN><BR /></SPAN></P><UL><LI>What is SAPUI5, where is it positioned, and where is it being used right now?</LI><LI>What does SAPUI5 consist of?</LI><LI>What does SAPUI5 look like?</LI><LI><SPAN style="font-size: 10pt">Can you give me an overview of some of the major features of SAPUI5? </SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style="font-size: 10pt">Can you tell me more about OData and SAPUI5?</SPAN></LI><LI><SPAN style="font-size: 10pt">What is Fiori?<BR /></SPAN></LI><LI>What does a basic app look like?</LI></UL><P></P><H3 id="toc-hId-753412142">Part 2</H3><P></P><P><IFRAME id="kaltura_player_1_p5s5dr9z" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-QszpA-HiI" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" width="625px" height="360px" frameborder="0"></IFRAME></P><P></P><P>In this part we dig a little deeper, and talk about what a more complex app looks like. There's an example custom Fiori app, built using the <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/guide/Components.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Component concept</A> and there's an 11 minute screencast that walks through that app, the controls used, and then looks under the hood to see how it's put together (bootstrap, parameters, Component and ComponentContainer, index.html, Component.js, views (JavaScript &amp; XML) and controllers, View containing the SplitApp control, custom utility functions, internationalisation, folder structure, and more).</P><P></P><P>Further questions covered:</P><P></P><UL><LI>What does a more complete app look like?</LI><LI>What skills do I need?</LI><LI>What are the next steps?</LI></UL><P></P><P>If you just want a future reference to the screencast, it's available separately here too: <A class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOO4szA2Bg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfOO4szA2Bg</A></P><P></P><P>Share and enjoy!</P></DIV>
