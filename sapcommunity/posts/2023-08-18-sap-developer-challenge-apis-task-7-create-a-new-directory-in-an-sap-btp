<P>(Check out the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/08/01/sap-developer-challenge-apis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Developer Challenge - APIs</A> blog post for everything you need to know about the challenge to which this task relates!)</P><P>This task is the first in a group that belong together, and in it you will prepare the ground for the subsequent tasks in that group.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-1651972326">Background</H2><P>The <A href="https://api.sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business Accelerator Hub</A> contains API and related resources not only for SAP products such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP SuccessFactors, SAP Ariba, SAP Concur and so on, but also for the SAP Business Technology Platform, as you can see:</P><P><IMG src="https://community.sap.com/assets/apihub-explore-menu-btp-highlight.png" border="0" alt="" />The Explore menu</P><P>Selecting this entry brings you to an <A href="https://api.sap.com/products/SAPCloudPlatform/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview page</A> with links to APIs, events, integrations, business processes, workflow management resources and more. You'll see that one of the API packages available is <A href="https://api.sap.com/package/SAPCloudPlatformCoreServices/rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Services for SAP BTP</A> which contains multiple REST APIs, including:</P><UL><LI>Accounts Service</LI><LI>Entitlements Service</LI><LI>Events Service</LI></UL><P>and more.</P><P>These APIs afford you programmatic access to information on SAP BTP, specifically about your global accounts, subaccounts, directories, entitlements, services and lots more.</P><P>In the next few tasks you will take a small journey of discovery, one that will lead you to be able to make calls to these APIs, and in fact you will end up making a specific call to get a feel for how things operate and what you need to make such calls.</P><P>In order for everyone to have something consistent to work with, i.e. so that you all end up making essentially the same call, and will get the same results, this task will get you to create a directory in an SAP BTP account, with a custom label. In a subsequent task in this group you'll use the appropriate API in this <A href="https://api.sap.com/package/SAPCloudPlatformCoreServices/rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Services for SAP BTP</A> package to retrieve that information.</P><H2 id="toc-hId--900184635">Your task</H2><P>Your task here is to create a new directory within an SAP BTP global account accessible to you. If you don't have one, you can set up a trial account for free - see the "Hints and tips" section below for details.</P><P>Here are the task requirements:</P><UL><LI>The directory should be created at the top level of the account</LI><LI>It should be given the name developer-challenge</LI><LI>It should have one label named task with the value 7</LI></UL><P>You can do this any way you wish. You may want to use the SAP BTP Cockpit. You may wish to use the btp CLI. See the "Hints and tips" section below for both these approaches.</P><P>The value you need to get, to send to be hashed and shared in a reply to this discussion thread (as described, as always, in <A href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/application-development/sap-developer-challenge-apis-task-0-learn-to-share-your-task/m-p/276058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Task 0</A>), is the length of the new directory's GUID. Not the GUID itself. The GUID consists of groups of hexadecimal digits interspersed with dashes. In calculating the length required, note that you should measure the length of the entire GUID, including the dashes.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-842625700">Hints and tips</H2><P>If you don't have a global account with which to work (for example, if you only have access to productive accounts at work and can't use them for learning), you can get a trial account on SAP BTP, and it won't cost you anything. You don't even need a credit card to sign up for one. Just follow the instructions in the tutorial <A href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get a Free Account on SAP BTP Trial</A>.</P><H3 id="toc-hId--1906044766">Creating the directory in the cockpit</H3><P>You can create the directory from the Account Explorer section of the SAP BTP Cockpit.</P><P>Use the "Create -&gt; Directory" menu from the button and specify the details appropriately, like this:</P><P><IMG src="https://community.sap.com/assets/directory-creation.png" border="0" alt="" /><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="directory-creation.png" style="width: 999px;"><img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/42307i80B95CFF3983B728/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999" role="button" title="directory-creation.png" alt="directory-creation.png" /></span></P><P>Once you've created the directory, it should look like this (you may have to adjust the display settings from the "tree view" to the "table view"). Note that the label information is available too in this display:</P><P><IMG src="https://community.sap.com/assets/directory-created.png" border="0" alt="" /><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="directory-created.png" style="width: 999px;"><img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/42308i07018F63E5D0C171/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999" role="button" title="directory-created.png" alt="directory-created.png" /></span></P><H3 id="toc-hId--163234431">Creating the directory with the btp CLI</H3><P>Of course, as <A href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TheFutureIsTerminal" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">#TheFutureIsTerminal</A>, you may prefer to go for maximum efficiency and use the command line. Luckily for us there's a great command line tool for accessing and manipulating resources on SAP BTP, and that's the btp CLI, available from the <A href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">SAP Development Tools website</A>. There are plenty of resources on the btp CLI, here are just a few:</P><UL><LI><A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2021/09/01/sap-tech-bytes-btp-cli-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI – installation</A> (blog post)</LI><LI><A href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/account-administration-using-sap-btp-command-line-interface-btp-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account Administration Using the SAP BTP Command Line Interface (btp CLI)</A> (SAP Help Portal documentation)</LI><LI><A href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RpkC85SLQDXx827kdjKc6HRvdMRZ8P5" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">The SAP btp CLI</A> (video playlist from the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/09/an-overview-of-sap-developers-video-content/#shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hands-on SAP Dev live stream show</A>)</LI></UL><P>Here's a sample session where I use the btp CLI to create the directory, in that I:</P><UL><LI>log on</LI><LI>choose an account (my trial global account)</LI><LI>use the create action for the appropriate group and object (accounts/directory)</LI></UL><PRE># developer-challenge-apis/tasks/7-create-assets-in-an-sap-btp-account (main %=)
