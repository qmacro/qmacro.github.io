<EM>Let's get together virtually over the course of the SAP TechEd 2020 virtual event and share our 5K walking or running experiences.</EM><BR />
<BR />
This year SAP TechEd is global and virtual - and free! I'm looking forward to what will be quite a different experience, I'm sure you are too.<BR />
<BR />
Previous TechEd events have given us the chance to meet and spend time together, perhaps even walk or run together in the mornings or evenings. There's even the official run in Las Vegas which is very popular. And last year in Las Vegas I got the opportunity to join <SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">phil.cooley</SPAN> on a quiet morning run which was wonderful.<BR />
<BR />
During the rest of the year, with Phil running "down under" and me "oop norf" I feel like we're a pair of bookends pounding the routes across the world.<BR />

Phil and I were chatting last week and thought it would be a fun idea for us to share our individual running and walking experiences during SAP TechEd this year. I know a lot of us try to keep fit and get some fresh air by running or walking during the day and I for one would enjoy seeing what others get up to. I think it's especially helpful to get outside and away from the desk in these current times.<BR />
<BR />
So - <A href="https://events.sapteched.com/pages/sap/sapteched2020/index" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP TechEd 2020</A> is a three day extravaganza, from 08 Dec to 10 Dec (i.e. the middle part of next week). If you go for a run or a walk of 5K in that period - consider making it a "UTFRW" - an "Unofficial TechEd Fun Run / Walk" and let us know how you get on, where you are in the world - share as much or as little as you like.<BR />
<BR />
Phil and I have set up a new Coffee Corner Discussion - <A href="https://answers.sap.com/articles/13200236/utfrw-unofficial-teched-fun-run-walk-share-your-ex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UTFRW Unofficial TechEd Fun Run / Walk - Share Your Experiences Here!</A> for you to add a comment with your experience. And of course, feel free to share a pointer to the discussion on social media - use the hashtag #UTFRW if you feel like it!<BR />
<BR />
This is completely unofficial and just a way of us sharing our own personal experiences - nothing more than that. Take care, have fun, and see you in the discussion!<BR />
<BR />
Phil and DJ
