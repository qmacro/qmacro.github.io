In the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/11/announcing-the-unofficial-and-unnamed-sap-community-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inaugural episode</A> of&nbsp;Former Member&nbsp;and&nbsp;<SPAN class="mention-scrubbed">uxkjaer</SPAN>&nbsp;'s new Community Podcast we touched on how interesting it can be to find out about other people's programming setups, even down to the actual screens and keyboards they use. I enjoy learning about how others work, what tools they use, what thinking or approaches they take in debugging, and yes - even what screens they use and how happy they are with them.<BR />
<BR />
I'm sure I'm not alone in this regard; moreover, I know there's a wealth of untapped, innate knowledge and implicit ability inside all of you that would be great to share. So I thought I'd contribute by giving a little insight into some small approaches and methods I find myself using. Nothing earth shattering, but I think that's also the point. I personally would love to see from others the equivalent of what I've just recorded - I know I'd be the richer for it.<BR />
<BR />
The recording is just over 20 mins, and it's pretty much unscripted, which is sort of the point - I didn't want to prepare anything, so you get a real sense of the workflow (lowercase "w") rather than something polished and less real.<BR />
<BR />

<BR />
During the recording, I mentioned <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Greasemonkey</A>, which was a wonderful tool that allowed one to write JavaScript to be automatically executed when certain pages were loaded; that JavaScript could then manipulate the pages to suit your needs. I note that the Greasemonkey spirit is still alive and well in the context of, for example, Chrome Extensions such as <A href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tampermonkey</A>.<BR />
<BR />
I used Greasemonkey back in 2005 to improve the OSS Note experience - you can read about it in this post "<A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2005/05/20/hacking-the-sap-service-portal-to-make-oss-notes-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacking the SAP service portal to make OSS notes better</A>" (unfortunately I lost the screencast but you can get a good idea of what I was building from the post itself).<BR />
<BR />
So I wanted to leave you with two thoughts for this week:<BR />
<UL><BR />
 	<LI>seeing others' development and debugging workflow can be of great benefit - getting inside the programming heads of your friends and colleagues and seeing their preferences and approaches can be not only educational but also fun</LI><BR />
 	<LI>the introspective and manipulative power that's baked into UI5 gives us all sorts of possibilities; the Greasemonkey style approach is by definition (and design) ephemeral, but I think that is one of its charms - nobody is claiming that the "solutions" will work long term, but there are plenty of situations where a quick temporary fix, or a scratched itch, is exactly what's needed to get the job done.</LI><BR />
</UL><BR />
Do you have some programming or debugging workflow to share? What tools do you use? What does your desktop and working environment look like? Let us know in the comments below.<BR />

p.s. For those that are interested, here's the final version of the JavaScript I put in my bookmarklet:<BR />
<PRE class="language-javascript"><CODE>javascript: (function() {<BR />
    opl = sap.ui.getCore().byId("application-bpmworkflowmonitor-DisplayInstances-component---InstancesDetailView--ObjectPageLayout")<BR />
       || sap.ui.getCore().byId("application-bpmworkflowmonitor-DisplayDefinitions-component---InstancesDetailView--ObjectPageLayout");<BR />
    opl.insertSection(opl.removeSection(3), 1);<BR />
})();</CODE></PRE><BR />
