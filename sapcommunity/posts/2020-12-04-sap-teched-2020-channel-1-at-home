<EM>I'll be watching all the Channel 1 content as it happens from the comfort of my TV - as well as interacting with individual sessions on my computer. Here's how.</EM><BR />
<BR />
Next week's SAP TechEd is almost upon us, and I'm looking forward to it, especially Channel 1, which you can learn more about in <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oasv3iBwyqc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">today's episode of SAP Developer News</A>.<BR />
<BR />
While I'll be interacting with individual sessions on my computer via the <A href="https://pages.sapteched.com/sap/sapteched2020/index" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">main SAP TechEd website</A> I'm going to take advantage of the fact that the entire Channel 1 stream is going to be broadcast as a Twitter Live Event too, at this URL:<BR />
<BR />
â˜ž <A href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1328768348725776384/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/i/events/1328768348725776384/</A><BR />
<BR />
And best of all, it's ungated, i.e. you don't have to log on to anything to watch it!<BR />
<BR />
So I'm going to set a Chrome browser tab up pointing to that Twitter Live Event URL, and then cast it to my TV via the power of <A href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/chromecast" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chromecast</A>.<BR />

That way I can enjoy the continuous content that Channel 1 will be offering -- learning from the hosts, moderators, guests &amp; presenters in Keynote, Executive live Q&amp;A, Strategy Talk and Live Interview sessions*&nbsp;-- as the sessions play out.<BR />

*you <EM>have</EM> registered for the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/19/sap-teched-developer-keynote-dk100-the-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Keynote</A>, right?<BR />
<BR />
Anyway, let me know how you're going to watch Channel 1 on the <A href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1328768348725776384/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter Live Event stream</A>. On the main living room TV? Audio only via your phone while walking? Something else? Let me know!
