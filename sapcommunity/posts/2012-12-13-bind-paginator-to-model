<HTML><HEAD></HEAD><BODY><P>I was wondering if anyone had tried binding a <A href="https://sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.commons.Paginator.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Paginator</A> to a model, to have the numberOfPages automatically set to the number of entries in the model's row set. </P><P></P><P>As an example, I'd developed a simple Panel/HTML representation of my weblog posts (in preparation for "<A href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZUXz5f1CHI" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Re-presenting my site in SAPUI5</A>") and then added a Paginator at the top to page through the posts. It looks like this:</P><P></P><P><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/attachments/storage/7/jiveimages/165840" width="450" /></P><P></P><P>In order to work out what value to set the numberOfPages to, I ended up using jQuery to parse the source XML that the Model had consumed, and count the number of 'entry' elements. You can see the code here: <A href="https://github.com/qmacro/sapui5bin/blob/master/snippets/model_to_html.html#L31" title="https://github.com/qmacro/sapui5bin/blob/master/snippets/model_to_html.html#L31" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/qmacro/sapui5bin/blob/master/snippets/model_to_html.html#L31</A></P><P></P><P>I noticed in the docu that the Paginator inherits a number of bind methods from sap.ui.core.Element, and was curious to see whether binding a Paginator could auto-set the numberOfPages according to the data.</P><P></P><P>Anyone tried this?</P></BODY></HTML>
