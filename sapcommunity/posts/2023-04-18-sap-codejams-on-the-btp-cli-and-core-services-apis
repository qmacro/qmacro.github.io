<P>Hey<BR />I wanted to write a short post here to highlight something that may be of interest. The Developer Advocates create and run CodeJams which are one-day hands-on learning and networking sessions on a specific topic. We have one on SAP BTP, specifically on the btp CLI, and on the related Core Services APIs (which let you access and interact with resources on the platform).&nbsp;</P><P>We've run this CodeJam a few times now and each time the attendees have enjoyed it. If you want to learn more and find out where we're running the next instances, head over to the <A title="CodeJam Events page" href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/eb-p/codejam-events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeJam Events page</A>. At the time of writing, we're planning to run a couple more instances in the next few months - in <A title="Isernhagen (Germany) in April" href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/hands-on-with-the-btp-cli-and-apis-isernhagen-de/ev-p/224169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isernhagen (Germany) in April</A>, and in <A title="Ludwigsburg (Germany) in May" href="https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/sap-codejam-btp-hands-on-with-the-btp-cli-and-apis-ludwigsburg/ev-p/219384" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ludwigsburg (Germany) in May</A>.&nbsp;</P><P>In addition, you may want to read this post:&nbsp;<A title="So, You Want to Host a CodeJam!
