<EM>We want to collaborate with you to improve our documentation. To do this, we're taking our first steps with the Open Documentation Initiative.&nbsp;</EM><BR />
<BR />
See the <A href="#updates" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Updates</A> section for new information.<BR />
<BR />
One of the things I've been happy to observe over the decades is SAP moving towards an increasing openness. To name just a few milestones, there's the inclusion of open protocols such as HTTP in the early days, the myriad and ongoing contributions to open source projects, the adoption of the open data protocol OData, the establishment of our <A href="https://developers.sap.com/open-source.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Source Programme Office</A>, and the <A href="https://openui5.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open sourcing of UI5</A>.<BR />
<BR />
Moreover, I've been excited to see the growing use of collaboration platforms such as GitHub, where we have our <A href="https://github.com/SAPDocuments/Tutorials" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tutorial content</A>&nbsp;and plenty of <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sample code</A>&nbsp;... and of course GitHub is the home of our open celebration of coding and collaboration &amp; what makes us developers - <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Devtoberfest</A>.<BR />
<BR />
So now it gives me great pleasure to introduce SAP's Open Documentation Initiative.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-957376165">What it is</H2><BR />
Collaboration is at the heart of many good things, and helps strengthen trust between participants. Our documentation on the <A href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Help Portal</A> is a significant meeting point between SAP and customers, partners &amp; individuals, and successful collaboration at that meeting point can pay dividends for all involved. Know-how, plus experience in the field, is a powerful combination.<BR />
<BR />
Our aim is to take the first steps towards making the documentation process more collaborative, by inviting you to provide feedback and contribute content.<BR />
<BR />
Looking at some documentation and you're not sure that it's quite hitting the mark? Send us some feedback and start a conversation in the form of an issue.<BR />
<BR />
Found something that doesn't look quite right, and you know how it could be addressed? Contribute a small piece of content, and start a conversation with us in the form of a pull request.<BR />
<BR />
We're bringing the content to you, in the form of Markdown resources in repositories on GitHub, where we can all benefit from standard issue and pull request workflow mechanisms that are used in countless collaborative processes.<BR />
<BR />
This announcement marks the beginning of a journey, with some small steps in the form of a pilot programme. That means, from the outset, only a very limited subset of SAP documentation will be included in this initiative. This will give us the best chance of making a success of things.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-760862660">The pilot programme</H2><BR />
We're taking some early steps with two relatively small documentation sets, and have a further documentation set ready and waiting to roll in at some stage in the near future too.<BR />
<BR />
First, there's the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/8f46c6e6f86641cc900871c903761fd4.html?locale=en-US&amp;version=Cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation for the SAP Business Application Studio</A>. This will be no doubt familiar to many of you, and that's one of the reasons we picked it.<BR />
<BR />
We also have a set of guidelines that describe how you can contribute. These are the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/open-documentation-initiative/contribution-guidelines/readme.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Guidelines</A>, and these guidelines represent the second documentation set that is open for collaboration. (If that's not meta, I don't know what is!)<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-564349155">A brief overview</H2><BR />
Here's a brief overview of what to expect.<BR />
<BR />
First, when browsing a page in either the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/8f46c6e6f86641cc900871c903761fd4.html?locale=en-US&amp;version=Cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business Application Studio documentation</A> or in the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/open-documentation-initiative/contribution-guidelines/readme.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Guidelines</A>, you'll notice a couple of buttons along the top bar.<BR />
<BR />
Here's an example:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/05/screenshot-2021-05-18-at-10.16.24.png" height="341" width="544" /></P><BR />
Via the <STRONG>Feedback</STRONG> button, you can provide feedback on the page content, either generally or specifically. This feedback provision will be via a GitHub issue.<BR />
<BR />
Alternatively, if you find something for which you want to offer some content contribution, you can use the&nbsp;<STRONG>Edit</STRONG> button. This will take you to the Markdown content for that page, in the repository for that documentation set, on GitHub. We have a new organisation there, <A href="https://github.com/SAP-docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP-docs</A>, which will be the home for the Markdown content and collaborative processes in this initiative.<BR />
<BR />
Here's what that content will look like:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/05/screenshot-2021-05-18-at-10.48.18.png" height="382" width="545" /></P><BR />
Then, when you use the <STRONG>âœŽ</STRONG> button on this page, it will launch the online editor, where you can make your change suggestion, and follow the standard GitHub workflow process based on the automatic creation of a pull request.<BR />
<BR />
Here's what edit mode looks like:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/05/screenshot-2021-05-18-at-10.57.51.png" height="346" width="545" /></P><BR />
Of course, if you're comfortable with GitHub and git processes, you can also make your modifications and suggestions locally and push them to your fork and then make a pull request, in the normal way, if you prefer that approach.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-367835650">Learn more</H2><BR />
There are a couple of ways to learn more.<BR />
<BR />
First, there's those guidelines I mentioned earlier. Head on over to the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/open-documentation-initiative/contribution-guidelines/readme.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Guidelines on the SAP Help Portal</A> and have a read through them, it shouldn't take more than a quarter of an hour.<BR />
<BR />
Then we have a <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/09/an-overview-of-sap-developers-video-content/#shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hands-on SAP Dev</A> live stream episode <A href="https://youtu.be/x7dbOpsquSg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">planned, for Friday 28 May at the usual Friday time of 0800 GMT</A>:<BR />
<P style="overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 0px"><A href="https://youtu.be/x7dbOpsquSg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><IMG class="migrated-image" src="https://community.sap.com/legacyfs/online/storage/blog_attachments/2021/05/screenshot-2021-05-18-at-13.18.04-1.png" height="308" width="545" /></A></P><BR />
You can join live and walk through the process with me, ask questions, chat with fellow live stream viewers, and learn how easy it is to get involved in the collaboration process. The live stream is automatically recorded, so if you can't make it, you can watch it on our <A href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNfmelKDrvRmjYwSi9yvrMg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SAP Developers YouTube channel</A> at a time that suits you.<BR />
<H2 id="toc-hId-171322145">Get ready</H2><BR />
To get ready, make sure you have a GitHub account (they're free, and <A href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">easy to set up</A>) and then familiarise yourself with the <A href="https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/open-documentation-initiative/contribution-guidelines/readme.html?locale=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contribution Guidelines process</A>.<BR />
<BR />
If you have any questions or issues with the process itself, you can raise an issue on the Contribution Guidelines repository directly <A href="https://github.com/SAP-docs/contribution-guidelines/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=meta&amp;template=process-question-or-feedback.md&amp;title=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">using this issue template that has the 'meta' label assigned</A>. Note that this is for when you want to create an issue about the process itself, as opposed to an issue about documentation content.<BR />
<BR />
These are early days, and we're looking to you, the SAP community, to help us make this collaborative initiative a success. Thanks!<BR />
