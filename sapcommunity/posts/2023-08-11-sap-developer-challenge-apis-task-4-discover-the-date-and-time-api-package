<P>(Check out the <A href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/08/01/sap-developer-challenge-apis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Developer Challenge - APIs</A> blog post for everything you need to know about the challenge to which this task relates!)</P><P>It's time to take a look at what the SAP Business Accelerator Hub has to offer in terms of APIs.</P><H2 id="toc-hId-1651290981">Background</H2><P>The <A href="https://api.sap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business Accelerator Hub</A> (formerly known as the SAP Business API Hub) is the central location for all things APIs.</P><P>While APIs are key resources on there, the hub contains other types of resource too, including:</P><UL><LI><A href="https://api.sap.com/allprocess" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Processes</A></LI><LI><A href="https://api.sap.com/discoverintegrations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrations</A></LI><LI><A href="https://api.sap.com/content-type/Events/events/events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Events</A></LI><LI><A href="https://api.sap.com/content-type/Workflow/workflowmanagement/packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Process Automation Packages</A></LI></UL><P>and much more.</P><P>But we're interested in APIs, which are generally organized by <A href="https://api.sap.com/allproducts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product</A>, and within product, by package. For example, the <A href="https://api.sap.com/products/SAPCloudPlatform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAP Business Technology Platform product</A> has APIs, Events, Integrations, Business Process and Workflow Management resources.</P><P>Selecting the APIs category, you'll see that the APIs are organized into categories (such as SOAP, OData V2, OData V4 and REST) and presented in packages. You can see this clearly on the packages page for the SAP Business Technology Platform product:</P><P><IMG src="https://community.sap.com/assets/sap-btp-api-packages.png" border="0" alt="" /><span class="lia-inline-image-display-wrapper lia-image-align-inline" image-alt="sap-btp-api-packages.png" style="width: 999px;"><img src="https://community.sap.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/41832iDD33996AC0AA9AAC/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999" role="button" title="sap-btp-api-packages.png" alt="sap-btp-api-packages.png" /></span></P><P>Once you choose an API package, you will find one or more APIs, each of which have one or more endpoints, which are usually arranged into endpoint groups.</P><P>You may find this diagram, taken from the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/blob/main/exercises/05-core-services-api-prep/README.md#learning-about-the-api-structure-authentication-and-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Learning about the API structure, authentication and use</A> section of <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/blob/main/exercises/05-core-services-api-prep/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Exercise 05 - Preparing to call a Core Services API</A> of the <A href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Hands-on with the btp CLI and APIs</A>&nbsp;SAP CodeJam material serves as a helpful example of this:</P><PRE>+-------------+

It's in the REST category, and has an API specification available in both YAML and JSON formats.
