      <h1>SAP TechEd here I come ... with session slides!</h1>

<time datetime="2004-09-30">30 Sep 2004</time><a href="/blog/tags/icf/" class="post-tag">icf</a><a href="/blog/tags/rest/" class="post-tag">rest</a><a href="/blog/tags/sap/" class="post-tag">sap</a><a href="/blog/tags/sapteched/" class="post-tag">sapteched</a>

<p><a href="http://emea.sapteched.com">SAP TechEd</a> is looming large, and this year it’s in Munich. (If you’re not in Europe, then SAP are holding TechEd events in Bangalore, Tokyo, and San Diego too). I went last year (in Basel), and was both impressed – by the quality of the session and tutorial content – and disappointed – at the lack of wifi and ‘net access in general. One thing that was lacking overall last year was a sense of community;<br>
everyone was there on their own, with the whole event feeling more like an exhibition or computer fair, rather than a conference. That, or everyone was avoiding me ;-)</p>
<p>This year, it’s going to be different. There’s a <a href="http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/">wiki</a>, there will be <a href="http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/index.cgi?MunichBOF">Birds Of a Feather sessions</a>, including a <a href="http://wiki.sdn.sap.com/teched04/index.cgi?SapAndOpenSourceBof">SapAndOpenSourceBof</a> run by me and my good friend <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/blog/">Piers</a>. Wifi and ‘net access has even been promised too. (Although when I compare the bullet points on the <a href="http://emea.sapteched.com">Munich</a> and <a href="http://www.sapteched.com">San Diego</a> pages, there’s a distinct difference – no wireless at Munich?)</p>
<p>But the biggest change this year for me is that I’ll be speaking. I’m giving a one hour session:<br>
**</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The Internet Communication Framework: Into Context and Into<br>
Action!</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>*Business Server Pages (BSP) technology is a great way to put together<br>
ABAP powered web-based applications. But that’s not the only way; in<br>
the grander scheme of things, BSP technology is ‘just’ a layer that<br>
sits on top of the Internet Communication Framework (ICF), the Web<br>
Application Server’s core foundation that provides a full set of<br>
object-orientated APIs for handling HTTP requests and responses.<br>
This talk will put the ICF not only into context – what it is, how<br>
it works, why it’s important – but also into action, with a live<br>
demonstration where we build, debug and run a simple web-based service.<br>
If you’re interested in looking under the hood at the engine that<br>
connects the Internet Communication Manager with the ABAP Personality<br>
world, and learning how to use it yourself, then this talk is for you! *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>**</p>
<p>I’m really excited at the chance to ramble and rant about some great parts of the Web Application Server; in many ways, the ICF is a bridge between the traditional walled world of SAP and the world of open standards. And this particular bridge is constructed with blocks that have ‘HTTP’ stamped through them.</p>
