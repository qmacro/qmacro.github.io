<time datetime="2003-07-11">11 Jul 2003</time><a href="/blog/tags/dashboard-tag/" class="post-tag">dashboard-tag</a><a href="/blog/tags/jabber/" class="post-tag">jabber</a><a href="/blog/tags/keynote/" class="post-tag">keynote</a><a href="/blog/tags/oscon/" class="post-tag">oscon</a>

<p><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/%7Emiguel/">Miguel de Icaza</a> and <a href="http://nat.org/">Nat Friedman</a> were keynoting at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon2003">OSCON</a> this morning. It was a great talk about the Mono project and a cool demo of <a href="http://nat.org/dashboard">Dashboard</a>. I managed to <a href="http://mmcc.cx/DashboardOnStage" title="log of #dashboard IRC channel during talk">convey</a> some of the presentation to the <a href="irc://irc.gimp.net/dashboard">#dashboard</a> folks who couldn’t be present. It was also really refreshing to see source code, system exceptions and actual open source on the big keynote display.</p>
<p>I discovered dashboard this week thanks to <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog">Edd</a>, who has been doing some <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2003/7/8#02:09">neato hacking</a> with some dashboard front and backends already. Dashboard shows itself as a little GUI window on which information sensitive to what you’re currently doing (receiving an IM message, sending an email, looking at a webpage, for example) is shown.</p>
<p>The heart of dashboard is a matching and sorting engine that receives information (in the form of “cluepackets” – how evocative is that?) from frontend applications (like your IM and email clients) and asks the plugged-in backends to find stuff relevant to that information, which is then displayed in the sidebar-style window, designed to be glanced at rather than pored over. It’s a lovely open architecture in that you can (build and) plug in whatever frontend or backend lumps of code you think of.</p>
<p>I’ve been musing about an <a href="http://www.sap-ag.de/">SAP</a> backend – wouldn’t it be interesting if the engine could get a match from R/3 on a purchase order number, for example? Of course, there’s nothing out of the box on the R/3 side that could be used, but as <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/3759" title="Integrating SAP R/3 with Open Source and Open Software">our talk at OSCON</a> (hopefully) showed, there are plenty of opportunities for the wily hacker.</p>
<p>And what about <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a>? While glueing Jabber stuff onto the front end is one thing, building a pubsub style Jabber backend could get really interesting; coordinated matching, CRM style features … Ooo, the world definitely could get very lobster-like.</p>
<p>And I know it annoys Nat, but I just had to point out that the GraphViz output for matching clues looks very arc-and-nodey … and we all know what <em>that</em><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/" title="RDF">leads to</a> :-)</p>
