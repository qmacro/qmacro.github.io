If you work in Basis, DevOps or development, then knowing how to view and manage resources on SAP BTP from the command line and via APIs is essential, not only for your own use, but for automation. In this session you'll get a feel for the command line tool for SAP BTP – the btp CLI – and also some of the APIs for managing SAP BTP resources. You can bring your own laptop and play along, or attend and just watch.

But now you want to get to the next level to understand and manage your resources efficiently, aligned with the rest of your devops workflows. In this session -- which sits at the meeting point between developers, devops, developer experience and the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) - you'll learn what resources there are to manage, and how to manage them with powerful tools that you can build into automated mechanisms. The command line tools and APIs are where the rubber meets the road, and you need to be in the driving seat.</p><p>You'll come away with an understanding of what tools are available, what they're used for and where to use them. You'll also learn how to combine them with tools in the wider ecosphere to help you explore, create and manipulate resources on SAP BTP. If you're interested in levelling up in this space, and embracing command line tools and APIs that give you superpowers for your SAP BTP environment, this session is for you.</p><hr><p><a name="introducing-abap-on-exercism-practice-and-improve-your-abap-skills-online"></a></p><h2>Introducing ABAP on Exercism - practice and improve your ABAP skills online</h2><p>When: Fri 01 Apr 2022 0800-0900 BST (UTC+1)</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1506911556029853697">General Info</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2zBmjqM8xo">Recording</a></p><p>Exercism is a website for coding exercises and mentorship to help folks gain true fluency in their chosen programming languages.
