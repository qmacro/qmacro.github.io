      <h1>The Developer Renaissance</h1>

<time datetime="2011-11-10">10 Nov 2011</time><a href="/blog/tags/aiazkazi/" class="post-tag">aiazkazi</a><a href="/blog/tags/interview/" class="post-tag">interview</a><a href="/blog/tags/sapteched/" class="post-tag">sapteched</a><a href="/blog/tags/teched/" class="post-tag">teched</a><a href="/blog/tags/techedlive/" class="post-tag">techedlive</a>

<p>At <a href="http://www.sapteched.com/emea">SAP TechEd in Madrid</a> this year, I had the privilege of interviewing SAP’s Head of Technology &amp; Innovation Platform (TIP) Marketing,﻿ <a href="http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/251736460">Aiaz Kazi</a>, on the <a href="http://www.sapteched.com/online">SAP TechEd Live</a> TV channel. The interview is available <a href="http://www.sapvirtualevents.com/teched/sessiondetails.aspx?sId=841">here</a>.</p>
<p>His team has an enormous scope, covering Mobile, In-Memory, On-Demand, HANA and more. While the word “Marketing” might be auto-filtered by a techie’s radar-filter, what became clear very quickly is that this group is totally developer focused. His group is already building a brand-new Developer Center (<a href="/2011/11/08/sap-developer-center/">I wrote about this earlier this week</a>) and is focused on helping the developer help themselves. What’s more, the group is staffed with developers. I’ve not managed to find anyone in TIP yet that doesn’t have a developer background.</p>

<p>Hasso is reported to have said “developers are the key to success”, and of course, we all know that <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?gcx=c&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22developers+are+the+new+kingmakers%22">Developers Are The New Kingmakers</a>. What becomes clear in this interview, is that there’s a re-focus on the developer in the space that spans the distance between mobile and enterprise. This re-focus is long overdue in our industry, so I applaud SAP for having the courage to lead on this. Yes, SAP will benefit because one of the keys to a successful mobile platform is a host of developers in the non traditional-SAP space. But if the message and focus builds, the developer at large will benefit even more.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a milestone along the way to the upcoming Developer Renaissance?</p>
