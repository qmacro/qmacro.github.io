A lot of that is technical, as folks get to grips with the configuration and development mechanisms that underpin Fiori. Perhaps I’ll have a technical “This Week in Fiori” (TWIF) post next time, but for now, here are some more articles, along with some observations.</p><p>**<a href="http://www.mobilemarketportal.com/mobile-platform/articles/383045-sap-fiori-brings-out-four-tools-improve-user.htm">SAP Fiori Brings Out Four Tools To Improve User Experience</a> by Steve Anderson **The thing that struck me about this article is that the <a href="http://www.news-sap.com/sap-fiori-apps-rapid-deployment/">tools</a> that Steve writes about – rapid deployment solutions, proof of concept services, and design thinking – implicitly underline the fact that User Experience (UX) has really arrived in the SAP world of enterprise software. UX has stopped just being a natural by-product of application design, as it might be when dynpro-oriented applications are built with a transactional focus; it’s now an explicit and important part of the overall process.</p><p>**<a href="http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-56438">SAP Fiori UX – Apps Overview with Screenshots</a> by Oliver Lehmann **This is a link to a great PDF-based resource containing details of the current SAP Fiori applications, of which there are over 300 (313 to be precise – see the “<a href="http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/July-2014/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/">Webinar &amp; More: Understanding SAP Fiori</a>” link below). With the organisation by Line of Business (LoB) category, and role, and plenty of screenshots, it’s extremely useful as a visual reference, especially if you haven’t seen may of the SAP Fiori apps in action yet.</p><p>**<a href="http://experience.sap.com/wp-content/fiori-guidelines/">SAP Fiori Design Guidelines</a> **Talking of great resources, one not to miss is this set of (beta) design guidelines for Fiori from SAP. I spent 6 months working as a member of the core UI5 team at SAP Walldorf in 2013/2014 and in my time there I really got to appreciate the tremendous passion, the effort and the attention to detail that the design and development teams have and exhibit on a daily basis. A lot of this detail, essential in making the SAP Fiori UX what it is today, has been collated and made available in a very easy to follow guidelines. As we move from “SAP Fiori” to “Fiori” and start to build our own apps, these guidelines will play an important role.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/July-2014/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/">Webinar &amp; More: Understanding SAP Fiori</a> by me</strong> A few weeks ago, Brenton O’Callaghan and I hosted a public <a href="http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/About-us/News-and-Media/Events/Webinar-Understanding-SAP-Fiori/">Bluefin Solutions webinar “Understanding SAP Fiori”</a> which was very well attended and fun to do. I wrote up some details in a followup post here, which you may find interesting. In particular, I’d like to draw your attention to a couple of things: there’s the <a href="https://code.bluefinsolutions.com/~dadams/FioriWebinar/AppAnalysis.html">SAP Fiori App Analysis tool</a> that I wrote (itself a Fiori style app) which helps you explore the details of the currently available SAP Fiori apps, all 313 of them; it’s accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVeQ4adHgaY">short explanatory video</a> too. Then there’s all the stuff that Brenton and I didn’t manage to cover, in particular a deep dive into some of the details of an SAP Fiori application’s architecture. We recorded this as a sort of “Director’s Cut” video “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM0ffI-GxGk">Understanding SAP Fiori</a>” as a follow on to the webinar itself.</p><p>So that’s it for this week, until next time – share &amp; enjoy!</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/design/">#design</a> <a href="/tags/fiori/">#fiori</a> <a href="/tags/picks/">#picks</a> <a href="/tags/sap/">#sap</a> <a href="/tags/twif/">#twif</a> <a href="/tags/ui/">#ui</a> <a href="/tags/ux/">#ux</a></div><style>.utterances {
