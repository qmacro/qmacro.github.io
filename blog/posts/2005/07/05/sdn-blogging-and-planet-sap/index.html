I wrote a longish reply, and thought it was worth putting up here (mostly because he didn’t use any of it ;-)</p><p>My answer:</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Well, there are many reasons. Here are the main ones: *</p><p>(a) History</p><p>I was writing on my blog before SDN came along. SDN came along, and I<br>was invited to write some posts there. I did. I continue to post on my<br>blog while contributing to the collective SDN one too.</p><p>(b) Freedom</p><p>The web is a great leveller. There’s no ‘us and them’ anymore. And<br>with weblogs crystallising the essence of publishing at the individual<br>level, everyone benefits. Get a weblog, express your voice. It’s<br>your individual press. I’m a member of SDN, but like everyone else,<br>still a guest there. SDN is run by, hosted by, and funded by SAP. So<br>naturally I feel restricted in what I can, or should, say. There have<br>been occasions when what people have written on SDN has ruffled a few<br>feathers. Sometimes because what they wrote is ridiculous and negative,<br>and others because what they wrote flies in the face of where SAP is<br>going, in a technology context (I experienced the latter first hand).</p><p>Writing in my own blog means that I know that I’m not going to be<br>censored, or have my posts pulled. This isn’t by any means a criticism<br>of SAP or SDN. It’s just the way it is.</p><p>(c) Technology</p><p>When SDN first came along, it wasn’t properly on the web. It was an<br>island, blocked off by the requirement to register and log on with a<br>userid and password. Many people (including me) hassled the SDN team<br>into removing the registration and authentication restriction (at least<br>for people who just wanted to <em>read</em> stuff). And they did. Kudos to<br>those who made the wheels turn (and they know who they are).</p><p>Now it’s time, in my opinion, for SDN to embrace community technologies<br>even more, and use the power of RSS (and / or Atom) to aggregate weblog<br>posts into one big ‘Planet SAP’. Syndicate blogs from around the<br>web-o-sphere into a single place. Many communities do this to great<br>effect. If SDN doesn’t do it, I’m sure someone else will come along<br>and do it eventually. Embrace, don’t resist :-)</p><p>So if there was a ‘Planet SAP’ weblog aggregation mechanism, I’d only<br>have to write on one blog, my own, and the SAP stuff would appear in SDN.</p><p>Actually, I write on three blogs. The third is a shared “Mr Angry” type<br>weblog where I rant. And rant. And rant.</p><p>As I was writing the bit about aggregation, I thought “Why don’t I do that?”. So I did. Using the excellent <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">Planet Planet</a> aggregation software, I put together <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/planetsap">Planet SAP</a>.</p><p>It’s in the early stages, gathering posts from only a small number of feeds. If you have SAP related things to say, and a feed for it, give me a shout, and I can add it. It’s just an experiment right now … let’s see how it goes.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/blogging/">#blogging</a> <a href="/tags/planetsap/">#planetsap</a> <a href="/tags/sap/">#sap</a></div><style>.utterances {
