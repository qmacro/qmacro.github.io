We both formed our lists in the first half of 1995, and for a while didn’t know about each other (or each other’s list). Running a list ate a lot of resources, both in computing terms and in human terms – I remember I was hacking on SAP at an oil company up in Aberdeen at the time, and after a day’s work would return to my hotel room and spend a couple of hours in ‘list maintenance’ mode each night. It was pretty time consuming.</p><p>Eventually MIT approached us both and gave us the opportunity to merge the two lists, and have the new list, which would be called SAP-R3-L, hosted and run by MIT. We still would have administrivia tasks, which we’d share and delegate, but it was a great offer (thanks MIT) and SAP-R3-L has left a great legacy.</p><p>Anyway, this year marks the tenth anniversary of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020906170450/http://www.cpub.com/archives/saplist/saplistinfo.html">sapr3-list, merlin, and SAP-R3-L</a>.</p><p>The nearest thing I could find to commemorate was this bottle of bubbly, handed out to people in Walldorf (I was working there at the time) at a party in the car park.</p><p>So, happy anniversary, SAP mailing lists one and all!</p><p><a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2005/07/04/the-sap-developer-community-10-years-ago/">Originally published on SAP Community</a></p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/sapcommunity/">#sapcommunity</a></div><style>.utterances {
