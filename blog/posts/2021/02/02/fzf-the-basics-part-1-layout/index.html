Now I have a better setup and understanding of the basics, and in particular how to control the appearance.</em></p><p>In the context of <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/02/01/do-less-and-do-it-better/">doing less and doing it better</a> I decided to start learning more about <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, the &quot;command line fuzzy finder&quot;. Learning more wasn't difficult, because despite using it for quite a while, I've never really read any of the documentation, and have thus only scratched its surface.</p><p>So I started with the first part of the main <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, and here's what I found.</p><p>The examples I give in this post are taken from a directory and file structure reflecting the <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote">SAP TechEd 2020 Developer Keynote repository</a>, which has multiple directories and subdirectories, lots of files with different extensions, hidden files and directories (and I'm not just talking about the <code>.git/</code> directory) and also stuff that we often want excluded, such as any <code>node_modules/</code> directories. Fairly representative and useful for illustration.</p><p><strong>An awareness of new and changed features</strong></p><p>I was using an older version of <code>fzf</code> because I hadn't upgraded it; a quick <code>brew update; brew upgrade fzf</code> later and I was using the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/tag/0.25.0">latest release</a>. Not absolutely essential for me, but doing this makes me more aware of the fact that fixes and features do come along, and also exposes me to options that I might not have known about. So an indirect but useful advantage already.</p><p>I'd <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/commit/68f3c40a76ddd2d8c5c08463855a59ed0e6d7c74#diff-53370cdb3bc79473f0579d40685f8516cc93a2c60b4382e60cb94c09d0c2bfc2R1">already installed the keybindings</a> keybindings (to get <code>fzf</code> to react on Ctrl-T and Ctrl-C) so that was still OK.</p><p><strong>Basic navigation</strong></p><p>I'd been using the arrow keys to move up and down in the list that <code>fzf</code> presents. The shame of it! Now I've learned that I can use Vim style key bindings to move up (Ctrl-J) and down (Ctrl-K) I feel less unclean. There's even support for the mousewheel, but the less said about that the better.</p><p>Anyway, it's time to get to the main topic of this post - how to affect <code>fzf</code>'s appearance, or layout.</p><p><strong>Layout</strong></p><p>Out of the box, <code>fzf</code> will use the entire height of your current terminal to display the choices, and this is more or less how I've mostly used <code>fzf</code> thus far:</p><script id="asciicast-388791" src="https://asciinema.org/a/388791.js" async></script><p>But it doesn't have to be this way; in the Layout category of options there's <code>--height</code> with which you can tell <code>fzf</code> only to use a certain percentage of the terminal's height.</p><script id="asciicast-388792" src="https://asciinema.org/a/388792.js" async></script><p>Moreover, the jump from the line I was on when <code>fzf</code> was invoked, down to the bottom of the screen where I was to make my choice, was a little jarring for me.</p><p>I'd vaguely (but mistakenly) thought that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> option, also in the Layout category, was something to do with the sort order of the choices presented. Turns out that the order can be reversed with the <code>--tac</code> option (taken from the name of <code>tac</code>, a command independent of <code>fzf</code>, whose name is the opposite of <code>cat</code>, see?) and that the <code>--layout=reverse</code> relates to the general presentation of the choices.</p><p>So with <code>--layout=reverse</code> I can reduce that jarring by having the place where I make my choice at the top of the list rather than at the bottom, like this:</p><script id="asciicast-388795" src="https://asciinema.org/a/388795.js" async></script><p>There's a couple of other options that I found that made the appearance even better for me, but these are more subjective.</p><p>First, I can get a border around everything with the Layout option <code>--border</code>. In fact there are multiple values that can be specified for this option; the default is to make a rounded border around all four sides.</p><p>Then I can save a bit of space by specifying the value <code>inline</code> for the <code>--info</code> option, also in the Layout category, to get the stats displayed on the same line as my input.</p><p>Here's both of those options in action:</p><script id="asciicast-388802" src="https://asciinema.org/a/388802.js" async></script><blockquote><p>In this and the next asciicast, the right hand edge of the border is not properly displayed or reproduced in asciinema for some reason; just imagine that the options are nicely boxed all the way around.</p></blockquote><p>Before we leave the Layout category, there's a couple of other options that can give a nice effect, especially for making <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/"><code>dmenu</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi"><code>rofi</code></a> style popup menus. These are <code>--margin</code> and <code>--padding</code>. I've found that to get a popup menu effect, it's worth leaving off the height option (<code>--height</code>) to get full screen:</p><script id="asciicast-388803" src="https://asciinema.org/a/388803.js" async></script><p><strong>Next time</strong></p><p>That's about it for what I've learned about controlling the appearance. There's actually plenty more on this in the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki">wiki</a>.</p><p>Note right now that there are 17688 entries in the list of choices presented to me. That's a lot, and far more than I'd ever actually want to select from. <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/02/07/fzf-the-basics-part-2-search-results/">Next time</a> I'll take a look at a couple of <code>fzf</code> environment variables, one of which controls what command <code>fzf</code> uses, and how that can be changed to affect what gets displayed (or not displayed) in the choice list, so I can address that large number of entries issue.</p><p>Update: part 2 of this series is now available: <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/02/07/fzf-the-basics-part-2-search-results/">fzf - the basics part 2 - search results</a>.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/autodidactics/">#autodidactics</a> <a href="/tags/fzf/">#fzf</a> <a href="/tags/tools/">#tools</a></div><style>.utterances {
