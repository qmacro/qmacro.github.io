Here's what I mean, and how I got inspired.</em></p><p>In October last year Samir Talwar <a href="https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar/status/1318904227935227905">tweeted</a> something simple yet profound: &quot;<em>Do less, and do it better</em>&quot;.</p><p>In my work and play I discover and start using various tools and technologies. The pace of change in this industry, coupled with the (not unpleasant) demands on what I have to produce, means that I often end up with only a shallow understanding of things. And sometimes these are things I use every day.</p><p>The nature of my job as a developer advocate (but I think this extends to development in general), in the context of that fast pace of change, means that there's always something new to learn, to adopt, and to incorporate into a workflow, process or solution. But that can come at a price - of limited comprehension and mastery.</p><p>To explain further, I'm going to stretch a metaphor relating to ploughing a field and sowing seeds.</p><p><strong>Ploughing and sowing</strong></p><p>As an individual, I sometimes feel as though I'm trying to prepare a large field and plant seeds there using a poorly hand-constructed and inefficient plough made of the wrong sort of wood and bits of string, combined with a seed drill made out of old toilet rolls and sticky tape. Not only that, but I'm trying to plant across the entire field, 50 furrows wide, as I move along.</p><p>Needless to say, the ploughing doesn't go very well, and the seeds are planted imprecisely, sometimes superficially, mostly wastefully, resulting in poor distribution, low growth and high energy expenditure.</p><p>But if I were to abandon the idea of going wide, and instead go narrow, focusing on just a handful of furrows, I could afford to take the time to correctly plant each seed, nurturing &amp; watering each one, producing strong plants with deep roots and healthy growth.</p><p>I've thought this for a while but never got round to doing anything about it. Samir's tweet has galvanised me into spending some time working out what that means for me.</p><p><strong>Consolidating</strong></p><p>So this year I'm attempting to &quot;do less, and do it better&quot; by acknowledging the tools I use day in day out, and learn more about them, restricting myself to a narrow set of topics, move a step closer towards mastery in each, and really benefit from everything they have to offer.</p><p>Here's an example from this weekend; I read the entirety of the main README for the excellent fuzzy-finder tool <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a>, all 16 pages. That might seem ridiculous to say (16 pages is not a lot) but I've used <code>fzf</code> for a year or so and never RTFM'd before. In my defence, I've also been constantly and painfully aware that I've merely scratched the surface. I've now discovered some <code>fzf</code> gems that I can put into practice immediately, and some areas that I need to dig into more.</p><p>Likewise for other tools that I use, tools that are not only essential, but which, when mastered, can make my workflows even better. I'm thinking of Vim (I've recently started watching my friend and colleague David Kunz's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFU7a7OMYfcpjtIpu2j47_Q">DevOnDuty</a> series, which I can strongly recommend), <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki"><code>tmux</code></a> (<a href="http://rwxrob.live/">rwxrob</a> is a great practitioner, and I should re-read Brian P. Hogan's great <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux2/tmux-2/">book on tmux</a> too) and of course the environment and language that ties it all together for me - <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bash</a>.</p><p>The lockdown has afforded me time to read more, and I need to embrace that and work out how I can keep that momentum up. I want to tip the balance over from always having my fingers on the keyboard towards stepping away from the keyboard to read, reflect and consolidate my learning.</p><hr><p>Update 02 Feb 2021: I've started digging deeper into <code>fzf</code> - see <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/02/fzf-the-basics-1-layout/">fzf - the basics part 1 - layout</a> and <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/02/07/fzf-the-basics-2-search-results/">fzf - the basics part 2 - search results</a> over on my <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/">Autodidactics</a> blog.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/thoughts/">#thoughts</a></div><style>.utterances {
