Today is the 256th day of the calendar year, and to those programmers amongst us, 256 is of course a significant number, in that it's the total number of different values that can be stored in 1 byte.</p><p>In other words, in a single byte, a range of values between 0 and 255 can be stored, or more pertinently, in binary, that's a range of values between 00000000 and 11111111.</p><p>So 256 is represented as 2^8, or 0x100. It's a nice enough round number to determine when to celebrate Programmers Day, right?</p><p>If there's one thing programmers do, it's learn from each other. And speaking for myself, I've learned from so many other folks out there - whether that's from poring over their code line by line, listening to them give a talk, or reading one of their articles or blog posts.</p><p>Moreover, there are a number of people who have really made an impact, and inspired me in ways that have never left me. These people have, directly or indirectly, changed the way I think, for the better.</p><p>I was lucky enough to be asked to record a short video with my thoughts on this, and I picked out a couple of folks who came to mind immediately. There are many more, but one of the constraints is that this video had to be 60 seconds or less, so there you go.</p><p>You can watch the video here: <a href="https://twitter.com/SAPCommunity/status/1172422213414244352">https://twitter.com/SAPCommunity/status/1172422213414244352</a></p><p><img src="/images/2019/09/Screenshot-2019-09-13-at-11.17.30.png" alt=""></p><p>I thought it might be useful to put the transcript here too, just in case you prefer to read. Here goes:</p><p><em>Hello, my name's DJ Adams, and I'd like to talk about a couple of folks who've inspired me as a programmer ... to be constantly curious &amp; share knowledge about programming with others. I still enjoy doing that today, especially in my role as Developer Advocate at SAP.</em></p><p><em>The first is <a href="http://jonudell.net/">Jon Udell</a>, writer for the fabulous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">BYTE magazine</a>, author and big thinker. His approach to solving problems with software was amazing; I still remember the moment I read one of his articles about running a web server LOCALLY on a laptop, unheard of then. Now it's completely normal.</em></p><p><em>The second is <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/">Randal Schwartz</a>, the original &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker">Just Another Perl Hacker</a>&quot;. Through his articles in tech magazines back in the day, he taught me not only about Perl, but about Open Source, and showed me that sharing knowledge about programming is win-win.</em></p><p><em>Their writing and knowledge sharing are embedded in my DNA and influences what I do here at SAP.</em></p><p>Like I say at the end, I'd love to know who has inspired you, and why - please feel free to put your thoughts on that in the comments to this post, and perhaps even publish a post here on the SAP Community yourself. Let's use the hashtag #programmersday, too.</p><p>Happy Programmers Day!</p><hr><p><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-blog-posts/happy-programmers-day/ba-p/13397057">Originally published on SAP Community</a></p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/sapcommunity/">#sapcommunity</a></div><style>.utterances {
