January went by very fast indeed, and it turns out I managed my <a href="/2013/01/02/30-days-challenges/">January challenge (no Twitter)</a> very well.</p><p>I uninstalled my Twitter clients (Tweetdeck for Chrome and Tweakdeck on my Android phone). I didn’t log into them at all. I was still authenticated with Twitter on the website* and visited<a href="http://twitter.com"> twitter.com</a> a couple of times to check something. No interaction, discussion or link saving, though.</p><p>So I’d say it was a big success. I did miss the interaction quite a bit – I missed the community of friends and colleagues (especially the SAP community) who have a big presence there. I missed the interaction and the sometimes thought provoking discussions. But on the flip side, I did <em>read</em> a lot more; in other words, I used the time that I might otherwise be staring blurry-eyed at the columns of tweets, and read a lot of stuff I’d <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>‘d. It was great.</p><p>In the latter half of the month I’d more or less forgotten about Twitter and had got to grips with <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110526626182299357893/posts">Google+</a>. It’s still no replacement for Twitter (mostly because of the people) but it’s a great platform — indeed, <a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com/social-backplane/">a social backplane</a> — and I’ll continue to spend more time there.</p><ul><li>until this morning, oddly enough, when I got an email to say that Twitter had reset my password. Odd.</li></ul><p>I know the idea of the 30 day challenges was not to attempt a full year of “no this, no that”; rather, there are some “do more of this, start doing that” elements too. But for February I’m attempting to drink no beer. That will indeed be a challenge, as <a href="https://untappd.com/user/qmacro">I’m a big fan of craft beer</a>, as many people know. It’s not that I’m avoiding alcohol altogether; I’ll allow myself a glass of wine here, a dram of whiskey there. It’s the beer that will be absent. As I drove out of work last night I’d mentioned to the inimitable <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110317969553719519075/posts">Jamal Walsh</a> that I was embarking on this challenge, and having just finished his dry January. gave me a tag-team style high five. Wish me luck!</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/30days/">#30days</a></div><style>.utterances {
