It contains ABAP service pack 3 and Java/J2EE service pack 7.</p><p><img src="/images/2004/10/Biostar200.jpg" alt="Biostar 200"></p><p>Since I had my small Linux server with me (that I used in my session this morning to demo some ICF stuff), we decided to blast away the previous NW4 install and have a mini installfest!</p><p><img src="/images/2004/10/InstallFest.jpg" alt="Install Fest"></p><p>Excellent. There‚Äôs something about interesting things happening on computer screens that seem to attract the inner-geek in people ‚Ä¶ within minutes we had a small crowd of people joining Piers, Mark, Gregor and me to watch the poor little server get hammered as the RPMs were installed from the DVD.</p><p><img src="/images/2004/10/InstallingNewNw4.png" alt="Installing new NW4"></p><p>I‚Äôm typing this post while the install goes on ‚Äì here you can see a screenshot of the progress.</p><h2>Small hack needed</h2><p>I noticed straight away that the install.sh script supplied on the DVD crashed and burned immediately. I had a little look (open source rules again üôÇ) and found it was because the script was trying to execute a KDE program ‚Äòkdialog‚Äô to display the licence and prompt for acceptance of the terms. (KDE is a desktop manager). I don‚Äôt have KDE installed on the server, so it was almost a non-starter.</p><p>Luckily I had a flash of inspiration, and created a symbolic link from a non-existent ‚Äòkdialog‚Äô to the ever-present X client utility ‚Äòxmessage‚Äô (I avoided copy-and-editing the script from the DVD as I would have had to change loads of relative pathnames and so on to get it to work from a new location). I reinvoked the install.sh script ‚Ä¶ and everything started perfectly. Hurrah! (If you look closely at the screenshot you can see evidence of this little hack.)</p><p>Anyway, 4 RPMs have been installed by now ‚Äì it‚Äôs time for me to go back and have a look.</p><h2>Update: Install complete</h2><p>Ok, after less than two hours, my new NW4 system, service release one, is installed and up and running:</p><p><img src="/images/2004/10/small_newnw4installed_39178.png" alt="New NW4 installed"></p><p>Nice work, LinuxLab folks!</p><p><a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2004/10/14/mini-installfest-in-the-sdn-clubhouse-at-teched/">Originally published on SAP Community</a></p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/sapcommunity/">#sapcommunity</a></div><style>.utterances {
