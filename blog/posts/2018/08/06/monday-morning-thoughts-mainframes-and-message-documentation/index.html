<p class="post-description-main"></p>

<p><em>In this post, I think about mainframes and a message documentation
aspect from the mainframe world that, while originally proprietary, is a
big plus for operators and developers alike and something I'd love to
see return.</em></p>
<p>On my route into Manchester for Saturday's run with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160309010719/http://mikkellerrunningclub.dk/chapters/manchester/">Mikkeller
Running Club Manchester
chapter</a> I listened
to an InfoQ interview: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/adrian-cockcroft">Adrian Cockcroft on Microservices, Terraservices
[sic] and Serverless
Computing</a>. From 2016,
it's a great interview conducted by Wesley Reisz, and contains much to
ponder even today.</p>
<h2 id="teraservices-and-mainframes">Teraservices and mainframes</h2>
<p>One of the subjects covered was &quot;teraservices&quot;, starting around 17
minutes into the audio recording. I didn't really know what they were
until Adrian explained; basically, they're services at the opposite end
of the scale to microservices. You know the sort of thing:</p>
<pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">smaller -- pico nano micro milli ~~ kilo mega giga tera -- larger</code></pre>
<p>The irony of the misspelling in the InfoQ title makes me smile - the
word &quot;terra&quot; (rather than tera) means ground, or earth in Latin, which
couldn't be further from where these services have their home - in the
cloud.</p>
<p>Teraservices run in memory sizes far greater than microservices. Adrian
made the comparison between microservices running in 100 megabytes of
RAM and teraservices running in 2 terabytes of RAM, on machines
available by the hour on Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that the advent of in-memory data storage and
processing with HANA and the corresponding demand for machines with
super large memory footprints has pushed the industry to the point where
terabyte-sized machines are available as commodities in the cloud today.
Adrian and Wesley laughed about things turning full circle (towards the
mainframe era) and running a whole bunch of services on one &quot;great
hulking machine&quot;. Making effective use of such a machine would involve
using the internal memory as a communications backplane between all the
containers running in that machine, a backplane much faster than any
network-based backplane would allow.</p>
<p>And yes, it does remind me* of the mainframe era in general. But more
specifically, making best use of specialised hardware for giant
workloads is what mainframes are all about.</p>
<p>*Of course, I've written about the mainframe era before, when thinking
about web terminals and the cloud in general in an earlier post in
this <a href="/tags/mondaymorningthoughts/">Monday morning
thoughts</a> series:
&quot;<a href="/blog/posts/2018/04/16/monday-morning-thoughts:-upload-download-in-a-cloud-native-world/">upload / download in a cloud native
world</a>&quot;,
and way back beyond then too: &quot;<a href="/blog/posts/2009/09/09/mainframes-and-the-cloud-everything-old-is-new-again/">Mainframes and the cloud - everything
old is new
again</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that the computing industry* cycle is at the decade
scale - in other words, ideas and concepts come around and are
(re)invented every ten years or so. I think the cycle is a little longer
than that, but a cycle does exist. On the one hand, mainframes never
really went away - they're still handling a large part of the world's
transactional processing in specific sectors such as banking and airline
industries. On the other hand, the conscious shift away from mainframes
in enterprise computing in the early 90's is now perhaps being
reflected, like an echoing musical phrase that comes later in the piece,
by a move to the cloud ... perhaps it's fair to say that the general
idea of mainframes are back, albeit in a different guise.</p>
<p>*and not just the computing industry - companies today are looking at
&quot;insourcing&quot;, where a decade ago they were falling over themselves to
outsource a lot of their processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-ibm-documentation-machine">The IBM documentation machine</h2>
<p>After leaving university in 1987 I started work at Esso Petroleum in
London, and joined the Database Support Group. Esso was an IBM mainframe
shop (I'd *just missed* the punched card era, which was a shame, on
reflection) and in the data centre, sixty miles away out in Abingdon,
Oxfordshire, there were IBM 3090 series mainframes running version of
MVS - first MVS/XA and then MVS/ESA. While the machines were remote, the
documentation was local, in the form of huge printed tomes that hung
from their spine on a rack system, in a special documentation room.</p>
<p>I have visceral memories of spending time in that room, selecting the
right tome, carefully unhooking it from the rack (they were usually
hundreds of pages each and quite heavy), opening it up on the desk and
finding, invariably, exactly what I was looking for. Then getting
sidetracked and spending more time than my initial investigations
required me to, looking through related documentation and, discovering
new worlds of related information.</p>
<h2 id="message-identification-and-documentation">Message identification and documentation</h2>
<p>What I remember the most though is how thoroughly messages were
documented. Not just that, but how the messages were actually organised
and catalogued. Messages were issued on consoles, and in batch job log
output, for example, and each message was prefixed with the message ID,
identifying the subsystem, the actual message number and the severity.
Over time, I found myself being able to just glance at the &quot;pattern&quot;
of messages in a job log, and discern, without much further
investigation, what had happened.</p>
<p>Even more impressive - and useful - than just the consistent
identification of messages was the actual message documentation itself.
Taking a printout of a job log, say, to the documentation room, I'd
reach for one of the MVS system messages volumes and look up the
documentation for the message identification specified. I'd find not
just a rehashing of the message line, in a different format, but a
decent and full description, thoughtfully and accurately written, and
where there was relevant action required, an explanation of what we
needed to do.</p>
<p>My memory might be rose-tinted today, but I honestly can't think of an
area of IBM big iron computing in that facility that was a mystery.
Everything that happened was described in messages, every message was
identified, and every identified message was documented in great
detail.</p>
<p>I've recently started carving out a little bit of time again for
<a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">Hercules</a>, the open source System/370,
ESA/390, and z/Architecture emulator (I've played around with Hercules
before: see the post <a href="/blog/posts/2005/05/30/turnkey-mvs-3.8j-on-hercules-s370-screenshot/">Turnkey MVS 3.8J on Hercules S/370
Screenshot</a>
from 2005).</p>
<p>More specifically, I've been looking at Juergen Winklemann's <a href="http://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/">TK4-
turnkey distribution of MVS 3.8j</a> (a version
of MVS that is now in the public domain). I powered up an emulated 3033
IBM mainframe and watched the Initial Program Load (IPL) sequence on the
console before logging in.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-06-at-09.12.50.png" alt="Messages in an unattended console of an emulated IBM 3033 mainframe"></p>
<p><em>Messages in an unattended console of an emulated IBM 3033 mainframe,
and a connected 3270 session</em></p>
<p>Here's a really simple example of what I mean about message
identification and documentation. Looking at the first two messages at
the top of the display in the screenshot, we have:</p>
<pre class="language-text" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text">IEF236I ALLOC. FOR JES2 JES2
IEF237I 00E  ALLOCATED TO PRINTER1</code></pre>
<p>Both message identifiers show that the messages belong to the IEF
family, which is for events relating to IPL, Job Entry Subsystem (JES)
and scheduler services, and more (see the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.1.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r1.ieam100/msgpre.htm">z/OS Message
Directory</a> for
more information). We're pointed to the system messages volume 8
(IEF-IGD), the older equivalent of which would have been hanging in that
documentation room all those decades ago.</p>
<p>This is the page from the volume that contains documentation for
IEF236I:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-06-at-09.22.59.png" alt="an image of a page of documentation for various messages"></p>
<p>Just look at the richness and precise nature of the information on that
page. That volume (IEF-IGD) is almost 1000 pages in length, by the way.</p>
<p>You can imagine that with some patience, a desire to master the very
explicit skill of navigating &amp; using the IBM documentation, and some
naus, there were few problems that occurred that you couldn't fathom.
Everything was there, if you only took the time to find it and read it.</p>
<h2 id="a-proprietary-plus">A proprietary plus</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why this was possible, of course, was because IBM
dominated the market, and was large enough to cause customers to buy
wall-to-wall IBM hardware and software. &quot;No-one got fired for buying
IBM&quot; was the phrase. Their dominance and size &amp; breadth of offerings
made it possible to produce such a wonderfully rich layer of
information, the likes of which I have never seen since, not even
close.</p>
<p>The proprietary nature of that era meant that everything that one did as
an operator, systems programmer or developer was within the context of
what IBM produced. The word &quot;proprietary&quot; has now taken on negative
tones, and there are good reasons for that. But I'd posit that one big
plus from the proprietary circumstances in this age was that this was
documentation done right. It shows that it's possible to build complex
systems and subsystems and make them understandable at an operations
level. One could argue, as well, that message documentation was more
important when the source code wasn't available. But the availability
of source code only helps a small percentage of those working with
systems like this, and doesn't excuse good documentation.</p>
<p>Today's open source world is wonderful and a major reason why we've
progressed so much in terms of computing, research and enterprise. The
nature of open source means, indirectly, that the kind of documentation
that existed for the complex array of subsystems of an IBM facility is
unlikely to be produced for the systems that we're building today. We
take best of breed products, tools and processes and glue them together,
and it's more or less guaranteed that the operator surface area is so
disparate and disconnected that a uniform -- dare I say ivory tower --
approach to consistent documentation, even a consistent way to output
and identify error messages, is not going to happen without some sort of
massive concerted effort.</p>
<p>One other thing that only occurred to me this morning while writing
this - the messages being output on the console of my emulated 3033
mainframe from decades ago are documented in modern PDF-based files for
IBM's z/OS series. <em>They are the same messages, and are still relevant
today</em>. Now if that's not solid consistency I don't know what is.</p>
<p>I yearn for the days when messages were consistent, easy to identify and
read, and were documented to within an inch of their life. It's one
aspect of the first mainframe era that I'd love to see revived in the
