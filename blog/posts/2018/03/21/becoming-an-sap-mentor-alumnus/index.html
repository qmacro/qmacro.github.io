Since then I've tried to act as an SAP Mentor should act; there aren't any written rules of course, it's just something that one should know.</p><p>In the years since becoming an <a href="https://www.sap.com/uk/community/about/mentors-program.html">SAP Mentor</a> lots of things have happened, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that have presented themselves to me ... as well as the Mentor shirts that take up a decent space in my wardrobe and that I proudly wear at events inside and outside the SAP developer ecosphere.</p><p><a href="http:/mcrcoderdojo.org.uk/underwater-scratch/"><img src="/images/2018/03/scratch.jpg" alt="Explaining some facet of our Underwater Scratch project at Manchester CoderDojo"></a></p><p>There's an end to pretty much everything though, and I've been planning to retire to SAP Mentor Alumnus status for a while. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is to make way for new blood. I can and will continue to be active in the community - becoming an SAP Mentor Alumnus doesn't mean that changes.</p><p>My move to SAP Mentor Alumnus status also coincides with a couple of other events; of course, there's my recent move to <a href="/blog/posts/2018/01/17/coming-home/">join the SAP family</a>, but there's also the end of the term of membership of the <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2016/03/08/introducing-the-new-sap-mentors-advisory-board-2016-2018/">SAP Mentors Advisory Board</a> (MAB). So I think the timing is right.</p><p>Thank you to my fellow SAP Mentors and the programme team, and also to my esteemed co-members of the MAB. I don't see this as a big change - I'm just moving from one group of folks I respect to another.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"></div><style>.utterances {
