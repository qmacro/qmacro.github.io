I have a lot of devices running it - a Google Pixelbook as well as an older Samsung Chromebook, an ASUS Chromebit and a shiny new ASUS Chromebox - the N005U. I even have a version of Chrome OS running on my old iMac 24&quot;, via Neverware's <a href="https://www.neverware.com/">CloudReady</a> system.</p><p>The advent of beta support for Linux on Chrome OS is very interesting and an opportunity for me to try out running Visual Studio Code (VSCode) locally. I wasn't disappointed.</p><p>I'm also very interested in the Application Programming Model for SAP Cloud Platform, and its agnostic approach to development environments and deployment targets &amp; runtimes. I installed the cds tool and the extension for VSCode to get a feel for local development with the model on Chrome OS. This post is a brief account of the steps I took, in case you want to do that also.</p><h2>Turning on Linux support</h2><p>Initially only in the Chrome OS beta channel, the support for Linux, at least on my Pixelbook and Chromebox is now also available on the stable channel. That said, I use the beta channel on both of these devices, in case you're wondering.</p><p>Turning it on is simply a matter of a single click in the settings, whereupon a Linux container will be downloaded and started up:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-15.22.18.png" alt=""></p><p>A short while later, a lovely calming terminal appears, the sign for me of a real operating system. This signals the successful completion of the process:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-17.23.16.png" alt=""></p><h2>Installing VS Code and CDS Language Support</h2><p>(See the end of this post for an update on this.)</p><p>VS Code is available for different platforms from the &quot;<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download Visual Studio Code</a>&quot; page. As the image is Debian GNU/Linux 9 (you can see this in the /etc/issue file), I chose the 64 bit .deb file. At the time of writing, this is code_1.28.1-1539281690_amd64.deb reflecting VS Code version 1.28.</p><p>While I was in download mode, I went to the <a href="https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud">SAP Development Tools for Cloud</a> download page and downloaded the official CDS Language Support feature for VS Code:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-17.34.56.png" alt=""></p><p>Note that as the Linux support is via a container, you have to transfer downloaded files to it. The File Manager makes this easy. I just dragged the two downloaded files into the &quot;Linux files&quot; folder that represents the home directory of &quot;qmacro&quot; (my Google ID) in the terminal above:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-15.51.41.png" alt=""></p><p>You can install Linux packages like the .deb file very easily, by using the file's context menu item &quot;Install with Linux (Beta)&quot;. I did this for the VS Code package:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-15.52.15.png" alt=""></p><p>and in a short time received a notification that the install had completed:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-15.53.45.png" alt=""></p><p>I then had a new icon in the tray:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-15.54.01.png" alt=""></p><p>I started VS Code up and used the instructions on the SAP Development Tools for Cloud download page (see above screenshot - basically following &quot;step 3&quot;) to install the CDS Language Support extension directly from the VSIX file.</p><p>So far so good!</p><h2>Install other extensions</h2><p>I installed a couple of other VSCode extensions, but these aren't essential. I'm a big vim user, so I use the Vim extension for VSCode, and I also installed the SQLite extension for comfortable in-IDE browsing of SQLite databases.</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screenshot-2018-10-16-at-19.49.32.png" alt=""></p><h2>Installing Node.js</h2><p>Next I needed to install Node.js. There are many ways to do this, but I find the <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager</a> (nvm) to be very useful, and it has a nice side effect of preventing you from getting into a tangle with root privilege requirements - everything you do in Node.js installations via nvm should <em>not</em> require the use of root (sudo) so you can't shoot yourself in the foot.</p><p>In the Linux terminal, I used the curl-based installation approach described on the nvm GitHub repository homepage:</p><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">curl</span> -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">bash</span></code></pre><p>and after a few seconds I was ready to use nvm to install version 8 of Node.js, which I did like this:</p><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">nvm <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token number">8</span></code></pre><p>Simple! That gave me node version 8.12.0 and npm version 6.4.1.</p><h2>Installing the cds tool</h2><p>(See the end of this post for an update on this.)</p><p>CDS is at the heart of the Application Programming Model and there's command line support in the form of a tool called 'cds' in the '@sap' npm namespace, available from the SAP NPM registry. Read more about this registry in this post by sven.kohlhaas &quot;<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2017/05/16/sap-npm-registry-launched-making-the-lives-of-node.js-developers-easier/">SAP NPM Registry launched: Making the lives of Node.js developers easier</a>&quot;.</p><p>To make use of the '@sap' namespaced modules, it's necessary to tell npm about this registry:</p><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">npm</span> config <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> @sap:registry https://npm.sap.com</code></pre><p>Now we can install the cds tool. I did it globally, rather than for a specific Node.js project. Note that because of the nice side effect of nvm mentioned earlier, globally still means within my user space:</p><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">npm</span> i <span class="token parameter variable">-g</span> @sap/cds</code></pre><p>That's the cds tool installed.</p><p>If you're following the SAP TechEd related set of exercises that I mentioned in &quot;<a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2018/10/10/application-programming-model-start-here/">Application Programming Model for SAP Cloud Platform -- start here</a>&quot;, then you probably also want to explicitly install the cds generator too:</p><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">npm</span> i <span class="token parameter variable">-g</span> @sap/generator-cds</code></pre><h2>All set!</h2><p>At this point, I'm all set, and if you've been following along, you are too!</p><p>We've got a lovely local development environment for the Application Programming Model, on a proper operating system, with great tools and a competent IDE with rich support for the CDS work we'll be doing.</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/DpppwFfW0AAq-MU.jpg" alt=""></p><p>If you're wondering what to do next, you might want to try the exercises in the GitHub repository &quot;<a href="https://github.com/SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight-node">SAP/cloud-sample-spaceflight-node</a>&quot; - happy hacking!</p><p><a name="updates"></a></p><h2>Updates</h2><p>2020-09-28 Since the publication of this post, a couple of things have changed. First, you can get the VS Code Extension for CAP directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace, see the <a href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/july20">July 2020 CAP Release Notes</a> for details. Also, the Node.js packages for CAP are now in the public NPM registry, and the main wrapper package for development is <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=sap%2Fcds-dk">@sap/cds-dk</a>. This means that to install CAP for Node.js globally, all you need to do is: <code>run npm i -g @sap/cds-dk</code>.</p><hr><p><a href="https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/set-up-vs-code-on-chrome-os-for-local-application-programming-model/ba-p/13377868">Originally published on SAP Community</a></p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/sapcommunity/">#sapcommunity</a></div><style>.utterances {
