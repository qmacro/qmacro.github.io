With these tools, languages and libraries you can efficiently and rapidly build enterprise services and applications in a full-stack development approach. It guides you along a golden path of best practices, allowing you to focus on your domain while relieving you from tedious technical tasks.</p><p>You can find core documentation for CAP in <a href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/">capire</a>.</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-09.27.28.png" alt=""></p><p>Begin with the <a href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/">Getting Started</a> section, as that will take you through the basics as well as detailing some best practices and reference material.</p><p>You can also find what's new in the new <a href="https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/releases/">Release Notes</a> section.</p><h2>SAP Developer Center</h2><p>In the <a href="https://developers.sap.com/index.html">SAP Developer Center</a>, there are missions, tutorial groups and tutorials.</p><p>In the beginner-level mission &quot;<a href="https://developers.sap.com/mission.scp-3-odata.html">Take a Deep Dive into OData</a>&quot; there's a tutorial group &quot;<a href="https://developers.sap.com/group.scp-8-odata-service.html">Build Your First OData-based Backend Service</a>&quot; which gives you a high level taster.</p><p><a href="https://developers.sap.com/mission.scp-3-odata.html"><img src="/images/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2018-10-10-at-16.26.31.png" alt=""></a></p><p>If you're feeling more adventurous, or more hungry for knowledge and insight, there are a couple of complete missions available too:</p><p><img src="/images/2018/10/Screen-Shot-2020-07-01-at-09.29.24.png" alt=""></p><p>The mission <a href="https://developers.sap.com/mission.cp-starter-extensions-cap.html">Build a Business Application Using CAP for Node.js</a> guides you through developing a business application using CAP.
