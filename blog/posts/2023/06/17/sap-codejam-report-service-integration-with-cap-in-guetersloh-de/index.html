I arrived in the warm early morning after a short bus ride from the town centre - in fact the bus dropped me off right outside the offices!</p><p><img src="/images/2023/06/arriving-at-reply.jpg" alt="Arriving at the Reply offices"></p><p>The setup was excellent. We had a breakout room plus two work rooms with plenty of power and Internet connectivity. The rather advanced TV / projector display mechanism almost had us foiled ... but after a while we figured it out, although at one point we were projecting onto the large display via a Teams meeting between me and Raphael, where I shared my screen and he relayed it to the display through his software-based connection to the display share device. Give me old fashioned direct HDMI cables plugged into the back any day of the week :-)</p><p>The participants were all eager to get started, and all had a great can-do attitude that we needed to work around some initial access challenges. In the end, in fact, every participant ended up going for the VS Code + dev container based working environment which worked brilliantly for everyone. This was also a great testament to the power and flexibility of dev containers, about which I have written in the past, in a three-part series <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/01/27/boosting-tutorial-ux-with-dev-containers-part-1-challenge-and-base-solution/">Boosting tutorial UX with dev containers</a>.</p><p>We worked through the exercises, learning together about extending existing services and schemas, external APIs from SAP S/4HANA Cloud, the SAP Business Accelerator Hub (formerly known as the SAP API Business Hub), and how to find and dig into APIs that are detailed there.</p><p>Then we set about importing an API definition into an existing project, learning along the way about internal and external mocking, various useful features of the CAP CLI (<code>cds</code>), and created a separate profile in the environment for a direct connection to the SAP Business Accelerator Hub's sandbox systems.</p><p>Not only that, but we learned about the different levels of integration, and got a hands-on feel for the best ways to extend existing CDS service and entity definitions, as well as wrap imported external services with a reduced surface area.</p><p>All this brain work and conversation was boosted by a midday break for lunch, which was provided by Reply and was delicious, thank you!</p><p><img src="/images/2023/06/lunchtime-break.jpg" alt="Lunchtime break outside"></p><p>All in all it was a very enjoyable day. All the participants worked hard, had some great questions which provoked interesting side discussions. This is a key part of SAP CodeJams - the conversations and collaborative learning.</p><p>Thanks again to Reply and to Raphael for hosting, and to everyone for showing up and taking part!</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/codejam/">#codejam</a> <a href="/tags/cap/">#cap</a> <a href="/tags/guetersloh/">#guetersloh</a></div><style>.utterances {
