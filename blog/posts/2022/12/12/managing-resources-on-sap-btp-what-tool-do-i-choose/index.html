<h1 id="managing-resources-on-sap-btp-what-tool-do-i-choose">Managing resources on SAP BTP - what tool do I choose?</h1>

<ul class="post-metadata">
	<li><time datetime="2022-12-12">12 December 2022</time></li>
	<li><a href="/tags/sapcommunity/" class="post-tag">sapcommunity</a></li>
</ul>

<p class="post-description-main"></p>

<p><em>There are myriad resources on the SAP Business Technology Platform, and
different ways to manage them. In this post I outline a way to think
about the different tools and when to use what.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update: The BTP Setup Automator described in this post has been superseded by the
<a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SAP/btp/latest/docs">Terraform Provider for SAP BTP</a>,
which fulfils similar functions, and more, in the same space.
The rest of the information in this post remains the same.</strong></p>
<p>The life and work of developers, Basis folks and operations specialists
and those with similar roles are heavily intertwined, especially in this
era of hybrid cloud, on-premises and DevOps-centric enterprise
computing. One result of this is that it isn't necessarily obvious which
tools are for which roles, because the range of activities across those
roles overlap quite a bit. This in turn means that folks might be
scratching their head over what tools are available, relevant and
appropriate in different circumstances.</p>
<p>In other words, with all these tools, when should I use what?</p>
<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>
<p>In no particular order, here are the tools that come to mind when
thinking of managing resources on SAP BTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://account.hana.ondemand.com/cockpit">SAP BTP Cockpit</a> is
the main user interface that affords a comfortable and graphical
overview of SAP BTP account resources, and the ability to create and
generally manage those resources with a minimum of structural
understanding.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/7c6df2db6332419ea7a862191525377c.html">btp
CLI</a>
is a command line interface that offers a very similar set of
facilities as in the Cockpit, but at the command line. Management
(and reporting) is achieved through the combination of ACTIONS and
OBJECTS, organised into GROUPS (such as accounts, services and
security).</li>
<li>There are APIs available for looking at and managing SAP BTP
resources, in the API Package <a href="https://api.sap.com/package/SAPCloudPlatformCoreServices/rest">Core Services for SAP
BTP</a>.
This package contains APIs for a similar set of grouped resources to
the btp CLI, such as accounts, entitlements, events, provisioning,
and so on.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-setup-automator">BTP Setup
Automator</a>, an
Apache 2.0 licensed project on GitHub, provides two main features.
First, a complete ready-to-go container image with all of the
command line tools you'll need for administering SAP BTP resources
and much more. But more relevant to this post is what it also
provides, which is a way of defining, declaratively, combinations of
resources that you want to set up on SAP BTP. The setup process can
then be run in an automated fashion, repeatedly if required.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more tools of course; when you drill down from a subaccount
and in particular into a runtime (such as a Kyma or Cloud Foundry
environment instance) you'll need environment specific tools such as the
cf CLI or kubectl for Kyma (Kubernetes). There are also other peripheral
CLIs such as the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/PRODUCT_ID/09cc82baadc542a688176dce601398de/93532bd72117429bb823a46ef2ddd003.html?state=PRODUCTION&amp;version=Cloud&amp;locale=en-US">Service Manager Control
CLI</a>
smctl, but the functions of this one in particular are also now
available within the btp CLI. So given this, let's focus on the &quot;top
level tools&quot;, because it's more obvious when you need cf and when you
need kubectl, but less obvious at this top level.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-tools-are-good-for">What the tools are good for</h2>
<p>I tend to think about these tools, from a use perspective, in a sort of
inverted Y shape. Before drawing that shape, I'll describe how I think
of these tools and for what I think they're ideally suited.</p>
<h3 id="the-sap-btp-cockpit">The SAP BTP Cockpit</h3>
<p>The SAP BTP Cockpit is 100% human-centric, appropriate for the
occasional user and perhaps even the regular user, especially for ad
hoc tasks. It doesn't require any investment in learning, you can
just sort of click around and find your way to what you need to do.</p>
<p>The native interface (yes, I said native, Web is the true native
platform, fight me) is comfortable, but it would be madness, not to
mention rather difficult, to try to automate any activities using
it. It's just not built with that use case in mind. Nor is it
designed primarily for power users. Nothing wrong with that, it just
isn't.</p>
<h3 id="the-btp-cli">The btp CLI</h3>
<p>The btp CLI is also for the occasional user, but with a path that
runs right through competent all the way to power user. The command
line is the dialtone of the cloud so it's right for us to embrace
it. And by embracing the btp CLI you get a consistent and uniform
way of viewing, interacting with and generally managing the
lifecycle of SAP BTP resources.</p>
<p>What's more, being a CLI tool, which is used in the context of a
shell environment (be that Bash, Zsh, or even PowerShell), you get
all the advantages of being a friction-free single step away from
automating what you do. If you find yourself doing something on a
regular basis, you can wrap the btp CLI command(s) in a small shell
script and run that instead, adding logic, testing, tracking and
whatever else you required.</p>
<p>The power of the shell is almost immeasurable.Even more, the
pipeline nature of the shell environment means you have a wealth of
tools to prepare data for, and interpret data resulting from, calls
to SAP BTP via the btp CLI.</p>
<h3 id="the-core-services-for-sap-btp-apis">The Core Services for SAP BTP APIs</h3>
<p>The Core Services for SAP BTP APIs, in contrast to the SAP BTP
Cockpit and btp CLI, are like precision knives. There is an
important preparation cost to using them (the resources you
manipulate with the APIs are protected via OAuth 2.0) but once
you're past that, you have a set of very sharp blades with which to
precisely manage your resources on SAP BTP.</p>
<p>Being of this nature, they're at the opposite end of the spectrum to
the SAP BTP Cockpit, for example, from a usability perspective. Not
for the faint-hearted or occasional user, quite the opposite.The
APIs lend themselves to being embedded in more permanent (less ad
hoc) custom automation scenarios; regardless of your choice of
infrastructure / DevOps language (be that Python, Go, or something
else) you can create custom tools that suit your exact needs by
employing the APIs using your language's standard HTTP libraries.</p>
<h3 id="the-btp-setup-automator">The BTP Setup Automator</h3>
<p>The BTP Setup Automator shines for scenarios where you need
automation as a core feature, are wanting to set up more shareable
and extendable resource setup scenarios (think of the BTP Setup
Automator as an &quot;open source version of SAP BTP Boosters).</p>
<p>Moreover, it's for the non-programmers, in that the definitions are
declarative, in JSON (with a comfortable assistive aspect thanks to
a JSON Schema sourced from its sibling the BTP Service Metadata
project).</p>
<h2 id="the-decision-tree">The decision tree</h2>
<p>Ok, let's get to that inverted Y shape.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-12-11.14.39.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that while I'm referring to this as a decision tree, it's not a
tree as such, it's more of a map, because it's perfectly valid (and
recommended) to move around according to what you're trying to do, and
according to the context of your task, what you need to do, how often it
needs to be done, and whether or not it needs to have humans or no
humans involved.</p>
<p>The top half of the tree represents a potentially continuous movement
between the SAP BTP Cockpit and the btp CLI. This of course will depend
on how occasionally or how regularly your tasks bring you to the
platform, and how comfortable you become with the command line (or how
uncomfortable you eventually become being restricted to a graphical user
interface, for that matter). It also depends on your skill level and
confidence.</p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing wrong with oscillating between the two boxes
here; use the advantages of the excellent 10,000 metre view that the
cockpit affords you, and then dig in for some real and more permanent
work with the btp CLI. While at the btp CLI level, think about whether
you want to automate some of what you do on a regular basis, with shell
scripting.</p>
<p>At some point you'll realise that you need to level up (or down in the
case of this tree diagram).</p>
<p>It might be that you've come to the stage where you have a collection of
related resources that you need to set up on a regular basis. For this,
you'll want to move to the more focused BTP Setup Automator. It's great
to be able to encode your requirements once and use that declaration
going forward (and share it with others if needed too).</p>
<p>But is also might be that during your &quot;main line&quot; journey moving back
and forth between the SAP BTP Cockpit and the btp CLI, you identify that
there's some specific activity that needs to be performed on a regular
basis, perhaps as part of some sort of CI/CD pipeline. Or you might see
that there's a set of related activities that are very specific and that
your organisation would benefit from a new custom program that makes
that narrow set of operations available, either in a lights-out scenario
or for use by others. For this, you can turn then to the APIs in the
Core Services for SAP BTP API package.</p>
<h2 id="in-conclusion">In conclusion</h2>
<p>For a platform as wide and diverse as SAP BTP, it's clear that no one
tool will be appropriate. For the various operations, administration and
interactions with that platform, different tools with different
approaches will be more or less suitable. And for the different levels
of skills, regularity or interests, there are different tools that are
appropriate.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post will make you aware of the different tools and
facilities, and give you a better appreciation and understanding of
what's there for you.</p>
<p>Embrace them all, take some time to learn what works for you, and don't
be afraid to experiment. There are plenty of resources available, not
least on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/sapdevs">SAP Developers YouTube
channel</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments what your preferences are, what tools you
use on a regular basis, and whether I've missed anything.</p>
