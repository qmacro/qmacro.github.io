      <h1>SAP and Open Source: the debate continues</h1>

<time datetime="2005-11-28">28 Nov 2005</time><a href="/blog/tags/opensource/" class="post-tag">opensource</a><a href="/blog/tags/sap/" class="post-tag">sap</a><a href="/blog/tags/shaiagassi/" class="post-tag">shaiagassi</a>

<p>I wrote a blog entry on <a href="http://www.sdn.sap.com">SDN</a> almost two weeks ago entitled “<a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/2687">SAP and Open Source: an analysis and letter to SAP and Shai</a>“. It followed the <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/matthiaszeller/2005/11/sap_slams_open_1.html">flurry</a> <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2005/11/sap_slams_open_.html">of</a> <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/11/0613255">comment</a> that was made after Shai made some alarming statements regarding SAP and Open Source <a href="http://www.churchillclub.org/eventDetail.jsp?EVT_ID=682">at the Churchill Club</a>. My angle was that Shai was complaining that people were twisting his words and taking what he said out of context, so I transcribed the <a href="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/z/e/200511/110905_CHC_EVENT.mp3">MP3 recording</a> of what he said, and it was worrying reading, even when you ignored his statements on “IP socialism” and innovation (I concentrated on the source code context).</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m glad to say that the conversation is still continuing, as it needs to. Shai hasn’t responded yet, but I won’t hold my breath. There have been (other) SAP employees that have given their comments, which I value greatly. If you’ve got something to add, don’t forget to add your comment to the post! There are a handful of critical debates for people to have in the SAP world. Critical for SAP, and critical for us. Open Source is one of those debates.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Discussion about Open Source covers the current <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/qmacro/72559493/">top three weblog posts</a> on SDN right now. That said, Shai still hasn’t responded.</p>
