<p>In May I was approached by a chap at SAP in Walldorf who wanted to ask me some questions on blogging (I <a href="http://scn.sap.com/people/dj.adams/content">have a blog</a> over on the <a href="http://www.sdn.sap.com">SAP Developer Network</a>) for an article he was writing for an SAP-internal magazine.</p>
<p>One of the questions was “<strong>Why do you write two blogs?</strong>“. I wrote a longish reply, and thought it was worth putting up here (mostly because he didn’t use any of it ;-)</p>
<p>My answer:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are many reasons. Here are the main ones: *</p>
<p>(a) History</p>
<p>I was writing on my blog before SDN came along. SDN came along, and I<br>
was invited to write some posts there. I did. I continue to post on my<br>
blog while contributing to the collective SDN one too.</p>
<p>(b) Freedom</p>
<p>The web is a great leveller. There’s no ‘us and them’ anymore. And<br>
with weblogs crystallising the essence of publishing at the individual<br>
level, everyone benefits. Get a weblog, express your voice. It’s<br>
your individual press. I’m a member of SDN, but like everyone else,<br>
still a guest there. SDN is run by, hosted by, and funded by SAP. So<br>
naturally I feel restricted in what I can, or should, say. There have<br>
been occasions when what people have written on SDN has ruffled a few<br>
feathers. Sometimes because what they wrote is ridiculous and negative,<br>
and others because what they wrote flies in the face of where SAP is<br>
going, in a technology context (I experienced the latter first hand).</p>
<p>Writing in my own blog means that I know that I’m not going to be<br>
censored, or have my posts pulled. This isn’t by any means a criticism<br>
of SAP or SDN. It’s just the way it is.</p>
<p>(c) Technology</p>
<p>When SDN first came along, it wasn’t properly on the web. It was an<br>
island, blocked off by the requirement to register and log on with a<br>
userid and password. Many people (including me) hassled the SDN team<br>
into removing the registration and authentication restriction (at least<br>
for people who just wanted to <em>read</em> stuff). And they did. Kudos to<br>
those who made the wheels turn (and they know who they are).</p>
<p>Now it’s time, in my opinion, for SDN to embrace community technologies<br>
even more, and use the power of RSS (and / or Atom) to aggregate weblog<br>
posts into one big ‘Planet SAP’. Syndicate blogs from around the<br>
web-o-sphere into a single place. Many communities do this to great<br>
effect. If SDN doesn’t do it, I’m sure someone else will come along<br>
and do it eventually. Embrace, don’t resist :-)</p>
<p>So if there was a ‘Planet SAP’ weblog aggregation mechanism, I’d only<br>
have to write on one blog, my own, and the SAP stuff would appear in SDN.</p>
<p>Actually, I write on three blogs. The third is a shared “Mr Angry” type<br>
weblog where I rant. And rant. And rant.</p>
<p>As I was writing the bit about aggregation, I thought “Why don’t I do that?”. So I did. Using the excellent <a href="http://www.planetplanet.org">Planet Planet</a> aggregation software, I put together <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/planetsap">Planet SAP</a>.</p>
<p>It’s in the early stages, gathering posts from only a small number of feeds. If you have SAP related things to say, and a feed for it, give me a shout, and I can add it. It’s just an experiment right now … let’s see how it goes.</p>
