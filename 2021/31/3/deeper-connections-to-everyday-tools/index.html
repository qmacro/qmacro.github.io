      <h1>Deeper connections to everyday tools</h1>

<time datetime="2021-03-31">31 Mar 2021</time><a href="/blog/tags/tools/" class="post-tag">tools</a><a href="/blog/tags/thoughts/" class="post-tag">thoughts</a><a href="/blog/tags/coffee/" class="post-tag">coffee</a>

<p><em>With some things, ignorance is not bliss. There are entire features of the tools I use every day that I know little about, and I want to change that.</em></p>
<p>Something mildly profound emerged from the combination two recent activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>eBay sales of items I've not used in a while</li>
<li>maintenance of my La Pavoni coffee machine</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://qmacro.org/2021/03/27/la-pavoni-maintenance-successful/">successful maintenance</a> of that beautifully designed manual lever espresso machine did take a while, but during it I guess I formed a deeper relationship with the device, built upon the existing connection I had already from the constant enjoyment &amp; challenge of getting everything aligned to pull a decent shot.</p>
<p>And the items I sold (SONOS speakers, an old Macbook Pro) are items I've not really had any relationship with at all. Yes, I used the speakers, but not every day, and since SONOS's <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90454672/this-is-disgusting-angry-sonos-customers-are-calling-for-a-boycott">meltdown</a> last year an active distancing and dislike has grown between me and the devices.</p>
<p>What was profound was that the lack of relationship I had with the stuff I just sold on eBay actually amplified the deep relationship I feel with the La Pavoni.</p>
<p><strong>Tools I use often in the kitchen</strong></p>
<p>I'd been thinking about tools I use often, since <a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1374655713331544065">noticing how worn my hand milk frother was recently</a>.</p>
<img src="/content/images/2021/03/milkfrother.jpeg" alt="Worn milk frother" width="200" height="138"/>
<p>I've had that milk frother for about 10 years. I've had a moka pot for about that long too - originally one from Bialetti, which I eventually replaced with one from IKEA (which is surprisingly excellent).</p>
<img src="/content/images/2021/03/mokapot.png" alt="IKEA RÅDIG moka pot" width="147" height="155"/>
<p>And I've had the La Pavoni Professional Lusso for almost 2 years.</p>
<img src="/content/images/2021/03/lapavoni.jpeg" alt="La Pavoni and espresso cup" width="300" height="400"/>
<p>Give or take, I've used each of these items <strong>every single day</strong> since I've had them. Often more than once per day. (In case you're wondering, I make M's latte with the moka pot and froth the milk manually, as that's how she prefers it, and I make my espresso with the La Pavoni).</p>
<p>These are just examples of course, but they're very visceral because I use all of them with my hands and what they produce is also consumed by me and M.</p>
<p>There's something special about tools like this. The bond, the attachment, the relationship that builds is more something than nothing. Anyway, before I get too philosophical, I'll get to the other half of this post, which is about tools I use at work.</p>
<p><strong>Tools I use often at work</strong></p>
<p>I like the command line. Give me a terminal over a GUI any day. The command line is a rich and powerful environment because of the expressive nature and the closeness you feel to the things you're trying to do (or manipulate).</p>
<p>That power comes from the combination of two things, the shell, and the commands available to you in your path (for more on the shell, see <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2020/12/28/waiting-for-jobs/">Waiting for jobs, and the concept of the shell</a>).</p>
<p>Without thinking too hard, here's a list of commands, of tools, that I use in the context of the shell, every single day:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vim</code> (editor)</li>
<li><code>tmux</code> (terminal multiplexer)</li>
<li><code>curl</code> (HTTP client)</li>
<li><code>fzf</code> (fuzzy finder)</li>
<li><code>jq</code> (JSON processor)</li>
</ul>
<p>(One could say that the combination of <code>vim</code>, <code>tmux</code> and the shell is my IDE.)</p>
<p>Of course, I use other commands too, and many Bash shell builtins &amp; features, but I'd say these are tools that I find essential.</p>
<p><strong>More learning required</strong></p>
<p>As well as being daily drivers, regardless of the task at hand, what else do these tools have in common?</p>
<p>Well, to be honest - there's still much that I don't know about them.</p>
<p>In many ways, one could argue that these tools represent the zenith of achievement in their area:</p>
<ul>
<li>there are few editors as powerful or accomplished as <code>vim</code></li>
<li><code>tmux</code> is the de facto standard for managing terminal sessions</li>
<li><code>curl</code> is possibly the most popular HTTP client mechanism out there, in command line tool form as well as in library form</li>
<li>someone <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/nsfdaw/improving_shell_workflows_with_fzf#c_2um216">said this</a> about <code>fzf</code> recently, and I tend to agree: &quot;<em>I don’t think any other single cli tool has ever had such a big and positive impact on my workflow than fzf has, it’s really a great piece of work</em>&quot;.</li>
<li>while there are other great options such as <code>fx</code>, it's <code>jq</code> that everyone turns to, to handle JSON data on the command line</li>
</ul>
<p>So while at least the La Pavoni machine has moving parts, it's still a block of stone compared to these tools, which all have such rich and varied features.</p>
<p>Here are a few example of what I've only recently discovered, or perhaps uncovered, with these tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>I managed to write some Vimscript to call <a href="https://github.com/mvdan/sh"><code>shfmt</code></a> to pretty-print my shell scripts on save</li>
<li>I <a href="https://qmacro.org/autodidactics/2021/04/01/new-tmux-panes-and-windows-in-right-dir/">worked out</a> how to get <code>tmux</code> to open a new window or pane in the same directory as I was when I invoked the open command</li>
<li>Having read <a href="https://seb.jambor.dev/posts/improving-shell-workflows-with-fzf/">Improving shell workflows with fzf</a> I learned about how to configure my own previews</li>
<li>I remembered (I'd forgotten) that I can use <code>--data-urlencode</code> to have values automatically URL encoded with <code>curl</code></li>
<li>I'm only just now starting to feel comfortable enough to embrace <code>jq</code> as a complete language, with my <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/dwr#L21-L38">first script with function definitions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As those lovely folks that join my live stream sessions* know - I'm not afraid of admitting that &quot;I've no idea what I'm doing&quot;.</p>
<p>*I live stream usually weekly on Friday mornings UK time - look for the Hands-on SAP Dev episodes on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNfmelKDrvRmjYwSi9yvrMg">SAP Developers</a> YouTube channel.</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, along with other folks in the <a href="https://community.sap.com">SAP Community</a>, I wrote up <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2020/01/12/my-learning-list-for-2020/">my learning list for 2020</a>. In it, I had a section titled &quot;Understanding core things better&quot;, and while that contained the kernel of the idea that I want to improve my understanding of fundamental things, I think I missed the mark somewhat. I failed to spot the tools that were right in front of me (or my fingers).</p>
<p>So I guess this is a reminder for me that I'm nowhere near done. That's fine, continuous learning is a thing, and as it is for many others, it's my thing.</p>
<p>Triggered by some mundane moments recently (eBay activities, gasket maintenance, the wearing thin of a simple wooden handle), I've come to realise what I need to do. And that is far from mundane. It won't be a short process -- I think mastery of these tools will only come over years -- but the journey will enjoyable and rich from the outset.</p>
