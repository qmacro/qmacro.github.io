<p><em>I've started to use the sponsors facility on GitHub to support developers. Here's my thinking.</em></p>
<p>There are many folks that I observe giving to the community. This giving takes many forms, such as providing software in an open source manner, supporting that software, sharing knowledge, and mentoring. I wanted to look into how I could provide a bit of support. I give to charity as part of my remuneration scheme, and I'm very fortunate to be able to do that. But that seems more of a &quot;given&quot; and not particularly specific, nor do I have any direct connection to the recipients.</p>
<p>There are various ways to support individuals online - I've used the &quot;buy me a coffee&quot; approach, I've sent small amounts via PayPal to folks to say thanks (e.g. for the <a href="https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/">Victor Mono font</a>), subscribed to folks on Twitch, gifted subscriptions, and so on. These are all avenues available to us, and I'd encourage you to look into them.</p>
<p>But there's an avenue that resonates quite well with me, one that was introduced to me by <a href="https://github.com/alexellis">Alex Ellis</a>. And that's <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a>. Subjective, I know, but I feel that sponsoring someone at this layer is a useful thing to do. The facilities offered by this mechanism also allow the sponsor relationship to be on a automatic and regular basis too.</p>
<p>I've no idea how far I'll go yet, I'm just really starting. So far I'm sponsoring Alex for his work on Kubernetes, small machines and everything in between, and have also sponsored <a href="https://github.com/koalaman">Vidar Holen</a>, mostly for <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck">shellcheck</a>, which has been a key part of how I'm <a href="https://qmacro.org/2020/10/05/improving-my-shell-scripting">trying to improve my shell scripting</a>. I've just started sponsoring <a href="https://github.com/rwxrob">Rob Muhlestein</a> for everything that he shares and for his long term efforts to share knowledge with junior developers on his Twitch live streams.</p>
<p>My contributions are minimal, but this is a scale thing - I would like to encourage you to consider doing the same and sponsoring someone for their work that collectively helps strengthen our community.</p>
