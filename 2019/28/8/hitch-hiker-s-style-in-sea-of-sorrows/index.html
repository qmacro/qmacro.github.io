      <h1>Hitch Hiker&#39;s style in Sea of Sorrows</h1>

<time datetime="2019-08-28">28 Aug 2019</time>

<p><em>Is there a link between a scene in &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot; and a scene in part 2 of The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy? I think so, or perhaps I hope so.</em></p>
<p>I'm listening to and rather enjoying the Audible Original &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alien-Sorrows-Audible-Original-Drama/dp/B07B3MZHTQ">Alien: Sea Of Sorrows</a>&quot;. Beyond being a good story (along with its related titles such as &quot;Out Of The Shadows&quot; and &quot;River Of Pain&quot;), the audio genre is new to me - rather than just being a narration, it's a full-on audio action experience. Definitely recommended.</p>
<p>Anyway, in Chapter 2, Rawlins, Morris and someone else is inspecting the <a href="https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/DSMO_Marion">Deep Space Mining Orbital spaceship &quot;Marion&quot;</a>, destroyed in unusual circumstances (in &quot;Out Of The Shadows&quot;, actually).</p>
<p>Closely examining a fragment of the ship, the dialogue between the characters goes something like this:</p>
<p><em>... &quot;OK, looks like a section from a docking arm.&quot;<br><br>
Morris: &quot;Bay three docking arm from the DSMO Marion, to be exact.&quot;<br><br>
Rawlins: &quot;You can tell which docking bay this came from? Is it that obvious?!&quot;<br><br>
Morris: &quot;No, there's a serial number on the end plate.&quot;</em></p>
<p>There's a lovely contrast between how impressed Rawlins is, and how Morris's response is honest and matter-of-fact, and how it conveys an almost but not quite imperceptible playfulness on the part of the author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Maggs">Dirk Maggs</a>. Because it reminded me of another passage, from my favourite series of all time, Douglas Adams's Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy, in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Original_radio_series">original radio series</a> from the late 1970s. In Part 2, or rather &quot;<a href="https://www.clivebanks.co.uk/THHGTTG/THHGTTGradio2.htm">Fit the Second</a>&quot;, there's this exchange between Arthur and Ford, who have just been picked up from open space and found themselves inside the Heart of Gold spaceship:</p>
<p><em>Ford: &quot;I think this ship is brand new, Arthur.&quot;<br><br>
Arthur: &quot;How can you tell? Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?&quot;<br><br>
Ford: &quot;No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Again, there's the banality of the answer which wonderfully contrasts with alternative and potentially amazing explanations.</p>
<p>I can't help but think that the conversation on DSMO Marion is somewhat of a small homage to this classic exchange.</p>
