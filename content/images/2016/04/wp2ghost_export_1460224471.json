What thing links my old University ([UCL](http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/GrandLat\/)), [Jeremy Bentham](http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/Bentham-Project\/), (whose [preserved figure](http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/Bentham-Project\/images\/auto_il.gif) sits in UCL\u2019s South Cloisters), and this year\u2019s [Emerging Technology Conference](http:\/\/conferences.oreillynet.com\/etcon2002\/)?\n\nWhy, the [Panopticon](http:\/\/www.dnai.com\/%7Emackey\/thesis\/panopticon.html), of course. An architectural figure, envisioned by Bentham, which allows one to see but not be seen. \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d is also the name given to a [wonderful experiment](http:\/\/www.actuallyworks.com\/panopticon) in \u201cblogger stalking\u201d (a phrase from [BoingBoing](http:\/\/boingboing.net\/2002_05_01_archive.html#85087344)) with avatars and a floormap of the conference area.\n\nThis Panopticon\u2019s creator, [Danny O\u2019Brien](http:\/\/www.oblomovka.com\/) (of [NTK](http:\/\/www.ntk.net\/) fame), put out some [instructions](http:\/\/www.actuallyworks.com\/panopticon\/explanation) as to how the thing worked, and mentioned that he would be streaming the metadata out of a port on his server. He asked if anyone could regurgitate the data to a Jabber room so other clients could grab it from there rather than hammer his server, so I took up the challenge :-) This is, in essence, poor man\u2019s pubsub (again) in the spirit of load dissipation: with a ratio of, say, 1:50 (Panopticon port connections \u2013 to \u2013 Jabber conference room listeners) we can relieve the strain and have a bit of fun.\n\nOk, well it was a very quick hack. The data coming out of the server port is a stream of XML. Hmmm. Sounds familiar ;-) I quickly hacked together a library, [Panopticon.pm](\/~dj\/Panopticon.pm), based loosely upon [Jabber::Connection](\/jabber\/jabberconnection\/), a Perl library for building Jabber entities (XML streams flow over Jabber connections, too, y\u2019know). With this quick and dirty library in hand, I wrote an equally quick and dirty script, [panpush.pl](\/~dj\/panpush.pl), which uses [Panopticon.pm](\/~dj\/Panopticon.pm) and [Jabber::Connection](\/jabber\/jabberconnection\/) to do this:\n\n- connect to a Jabber server and authenticate\n- join a conference room\n- open up the panopticon server port\n- fire the data that comes out of the port into the conference room for all to see and read, on a continuous basis\n\nThe Panopticon data is XML. Jabber is XML. So I decided the nice thing to do would be to avoid just blurting XML into the conference room \u2013 that would be like shouting gobbledygook in a room full of people. Instead, I wrote something sensible to the room each time some data fell out of the end of the Panopticon socket (the name of the blogger\u2019s avatar), and *attached* the actual Panopticon XML as an extension to the groupchat message. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n<dl><dt>Panopticon produces this:<\/dt><dd><icon id='4ee9da17f5839275ad0ca5d58c2bacaa'> <x>456<\/x> <y>255<\/y> <\/icon>\n\n<\/dd><dt>panpush.pl sends this to the room:<\/dt><dd><message to='panopticon@conf.gnu.mine.nu' type='groupchat'> DJ Adams <x xmlns='panopticon:icon'> <icon id='4ee9da17f5839275ad0ca5d58c2bacaa'> <x>456<\/x> <y>255<\/y> <\/icon> <\/x> <\/message>\n\n<\/dd><\/dl>The scary thing is that it seems to work! Grab your nearest Jabber client and enter room\n\n> **panopticon@conf.gnu.mine.nu**\n\n(remember, you don\u2019t have to have a Jabber user account on gnu.mine.nu to join a conference room there \u2013 just use your normal Jabber account, say, at jabber.org). If it\u2019s still working, you should see \u2018panopticon\u2019 in that room \u2013 that\u2019s the panpush.pl script. When some avatar metadata changes and pops out of the Panopticon server\u2019s port, it will appear in the room \u2013 currently represented as the avatar\u2019s name.\n\nWant more? Want to actually do something with the data in the room?\n\nWell, I\u2019ve just written an example antithesis to panpush.pl \u2013 [panclient.pl](\/~dj\/panclient.pl). This connects to the conference room, and listens out for packets containing the panopticon XML extensions. It just prints them out, but of course you can do with the data as you please. It\u2019s just an example.\n\nOh, one more thing. As [panpush.pl](\/~dj\/panpush.pl) catches the panopticon XML and squirts it into the room, it also caches the actual avatar data, keyed by each icon\u2019s id attribute. I plan to allow queries to be sent to the \u2018panopticon\u2019 room occupant, probably in the form of **jabber:iq:browse** IQ queries, so that clients can find out about what avatars are currently around, and what properties they have (name, url, xy coordinates, and so on).\n\n\n","html":"<p>Everything that goes around, comes around.

Or even [Jabber](..\/..\/..\/jabber\/jrpc\/)! Both lend themselves to asynchronous interaction more than HTTP does. Or so it seems to me. Both involve to a greater or lesser degree some modicum of store-n-forward, allowing the endpoints to talk at their leisure.\n\nOf course, this is all very high level, and based, as usual, on my ignorance of detail.

While \u201c*feeds*\u201d isn\u2019t explicitly there, and \u201c*help*\u201d is the closest fit from the choices given, I\u2019ve nevertheless decided to keep the link type \u201c*feeds*\u201c, and qualify that definition with a meta data profile. Just to see where this leads.\n\nThis is what I interpreted from the [W3C](http:\/\/www.w3c.org\/) HTML specs:\n\n1. There is a provision, following the definition of the explicitly [allowed values](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/types.html#type-links), to define new link types for the *rel* attribute:  \n> \u201cAuthors may wish to define additional link types not described in this specification. If they do so, they should use a profile to cite the conventions used to define the link types.\u201d\n2. You can do this by providing the location a meta data profile in a *profile* attribute of the HTML document\u2019s <head\/> tag.\n3. According to the [explanation](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/struct\/global.html#profiles) of the meta data profiles, these locations are URIs, which can be globally unique names, or actual links to be followed.\n4.

It\u2019s a SOAP-based frontend to the weblogs.com \u2018Recently Changed Weblogs\u2019 information. You tell the interface what weblog URLs you\u2019re interested in and it gives you SOAPy pings at the URL you specified whenever they\u2019re updated, taking care of the nasty polling business for you (and for everyone else, which is the whole point).\n\nInspired by this generous infrastructural act, I put together an experimental bit of code which reflects this mechanism out into Jabber plasma. It\u2019s a pubsub concentrator that sits in front of Simon\u2019s Subscriber Interface and allows any app that can send and receive simple Jabber packets to request and receive weblogs.com-based update pings via this subscriber interface, without all the tedious mucking about in HTTP and SOAP protocols [1] (with apologies to Douglas Adams).\n\nThe idea is that in the same way that the [Jabber extensions for Danny O\u2019Brien\u2019s Panopticon](..\/..\/2002\/May\/15#panopticon) gave the Panopticon server some breathing space by effectively diffusing the data to Jabber entities via a conference room, so this new mechanism abstracts the Subscriber Interface out and allows many subscribers to share one subscription connection. Publish\/Subscribe. One publisher, many subscribers. The publisher, in this case the Subscriber Interface, only has to send out one SOAPy ping per updated weblog URL to reach potentially many notification recipients (subscribers).\n\nSo rather than reproduce a blogToaster-like mechanism, I thought I\u2019d have a go at putting together a mini-infrastructure on top of which lots of different blogToaster-like mechanisms could be built.\n\nThe mechanism is running at JID \u2018**weblogs.gnu.mine.nu**\u2018, and the packets are based on the [Jabber PubSub JEP](http:\/\/www.jabber.org\/jeps\/jep-0024.html). It\u2019s still alpha, and likely to fall over if you look at it the wrong way.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how it works. You send a \u2018subscribe\u2019 packet, saying you want to be notified when [DJ\u2019s Weblog](\/qmacro\/blog) is updated:\n\nSEND: <iq type='set' to='weblogs.gnu.mine.nu'> <query xmlns='pipetree:iq:pubsub'> <subscribe to='http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro'\/> <\/query> <\/iq>\n\nThen, whenever the weblog specified is updated, you get a packet pushed to you like this:\n\nRECV: <iq type='set' from='weblogs.gnu.mine.nu' to='user@host\/resource'> <query xmlns='pipetree:iq:pubsub'> <publish from='http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro'> <url>http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro<\/url> <name>DJ's Weblog<\/name> <timestamp>2002-07-03T21:35:51Z<\/timestamp> <\/publish> <\/query> <\/iq>\n\nThe information in the *name*, *url* and *timestamp* tags (in the publish IQ) is taken directly from the *weblog* tag in the SOAP-enveloped callback message described at the bottom of the [Subscriber Interface description](http:\/\/www.pocketsoap.com\/weblog\/stories\/2002\/02\/12\/subscriberInterfaceForWeblogscom.html) page.\n\nFor now, as a bonus (or an immoral twisting of the Jabber pubsub packet philosophy, depending on how you look at it ;-) I\u2019ve set up the mechanism to send you not only a publish IQ as shown above, but also a simple *message* packet with the same information, so that you can use your regular Jabber client to \u2018process\u2019 (read: see) the pings. So if you\u2019re feeling brave, break out your Jabber debug app and send a few pubsub packets to **weblogs.gnu.mine.nu**. If you\u2019re not feeling so brave, you can wait until tomorrow \u2013 I\u2019ve got a a few helper example apps that will hopefully make things clearer. In either case, remember this: if it works, it works because of the coolness of what [Dave W](http:\/\/www.scripting.com\/) [built](http:\/\/www.weblogs.com\/), the coolness of what [Simon](http:\/\/www.pocketsoap.com\/weblog\/index.html \"Simon Fell's weblog\") [built](http:\/\/www.pocketsoap.com\/weblog\/stories\/2002\/02\/12\/subscriberInterfaceForWeblogscom.html), and the coolness that is \u2018net based collaboration and open standards. Time for bed now.\n\n[1] Ooh, talking of HTTP and SOAP protocols, I just read an interesting [XML-SIG post](http:\/\/mail.python.org\/pipermail\/xml-sig\/2002-February\/007183.html) by [Paul Prescod](http:\/\/www.prescod.net\/) which made some valid (but also nicely philosophical, IMHO) points towards the end of the mail regarding whether SOAP is actually a protocol (as opposed to, say, an encoding), and how much, despite its \u2018independence\u2019 of transport, it depends upon its binding to HTTP, as much as any protocol depends on its binding to a lower-level transport.

In a still handwavy sort of way, I understand that RDF is important for the (semantic|data) web that is to form as a layer above the current writhing disconnected mass of URIs. But I realised I hadn\u2019t really thought much about what the RDF bits of RSS (1.0) were, and much less what they were for. I get the feeling that for most mortals, including me, including RDF in their RSS feeds seemed like building a racing car to do the shopping, and never even taking it out on a track after the shopping was finished. Actually, perhaps some people didn\u2019t even see the racing car as a whole. So I did a little reading and thinking.\n\nThe point of RDF is to be able to describe resources. Resource Description Framework. So far so good. But what are resources? They\u2019re things that we can point to on the web \u2013 things with URIs (REST axioms, anyone?). With RDF, we can make assertions, state facts, about things. These assertions are always in the form of\n\n> *this thing* has *this property* with *this value*.\n\nThese assertions are often expressed as having the form \u2018subject-predicate-object\u2019 and are referred to as \u2018triples\u2019. RDF exists independently of XML, but what I (and lots of other people) recognise RDF as is its XML incarnation. Here\u2019s a simple example:\n\n> <rdf:Description rdf:about='http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro'> <dc:title>DJ's Weblog<\/dc:title> <\/rdf:Description>\n\nThis makes the assertion that\n\n> *the resource at [http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro](..\/..\/..\/qmacro \"DJ's Weblog\")* has *a title (as defined in the [Dublin Core](http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.0\/ \"Dublin Core elements\"))* with the value \u201c*DJ\u2019s Weblog*\u201c.\n\nWhat\u2019s obvious is that *subjects* are URIs. It\u2019s also easy to realise that *objects* can be URIs too \u2013 instead of having a Literal (\u201cDJ\u2019s Weblog\u201d) as in the example above, you can have another resource (a URI), for example:\n\n> <foaf:Person rdf:ID=\"qmacro\"> <foaf:depiction rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/~dj\/dj.png\"\/> <\/foaf:Person>\n\nHere, the object, the value of the foaf:depiction property, is a URI ([http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/~dj\/dj.png](\/~dj\/dj.png \"DJ's ugly mug\")) pointed to directly with the rdf:resource attribute.\n\nBut what\u2019s really mindblowingly meta is that the predicate parts of assertion triples, the *properties*, are resources, addressable by URIs, too. Yikes! this means that RDF can be used to describe \u2026 RDF. In case you\u2019re wondering, the properties (*dc:title*, *foaf:depiction*) don\u2019t look like URIs, but they are URIs in disguise \u2013 the URI for each property is made up from the namespace qualifying the XML element name, and the element name fragment on the end of that. So for example, the *dc* namespace http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/, plus the element name *title*, gives:\n\n> [http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/title](http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/title)\n\nAnyway, the point of RDF here is to be able to make connections between things on the web. To define, or describe, relations between things; to add richness to the data out there \u2013 to declare data about the data. If we, or our machines, can understand things about the data we\u2019re throwing around, the world will be a better place for it. And to all those meta-data agnostics out there, ask yourself this \u2013 where would the database world be without data dictionaries?\n\nSo, what about these triples that exist in RSS 1.0? They\u2019re just to add a layer of richness, a seam to be mined by RDF-aware tools. Let\u2019s have a look at a simple RSS 1.0 file. I\u2019ve highlighted the RDF bits (slightly cut to fit):\n\n<**rdf:RDF****xmlns:rdf=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"** xmlns=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/rss\/1.0\/\"> <channel **rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/xml\">** <title>DJ's Weblog<\/title> <link>http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro<\/link> <description> Why make things simple when you can make them complicated? <\/description> ** <items> <rdf:Seq> <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/www...#tech\/moz-tab-bookmark\"\/> <rdf:li rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/www...#tech\/google-idempotent\" \/> <\/rdf:Seq> <\/items> ** <\/channel> <item **rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www...#tech\/moz-tab-bookmark\"**> <title>Mozilla \"Bookmark This Group of Tabs\"<\/title> <link>http:\/\/www...#tech\/moz-tab-bookmark<\/link> <description> I was just reading some background stuff ... <\/description> <\/item> ... <**\/rdf:RDF**>\n\nHere\u2019s what we have, RDF-wise:\n\n- We have the **rdf** namespace (http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#), which qualifies the rdf elements in the file. The root element is **RDF**, which is standard for an RDF document.\n- An RDF document is made up of a list of descriptions of resources. The resources here are identified, via their URIs of course, via the **rdf:about** attributes on the <channel\/> and <item\/> elements. (Notice that the channel and item elements are on the same level, XML-wise.)\n- Then we have the **<items\/>** element inside the <channel\/> element, containing an RDF structure called a sequence (**rdf:Seq**), which is basically an ordered container for things.\n\nAnd what do these RDF things do? First, each resource \u2013 the RSS channel, or the Weblog it represents, and the actual items \u2013 are identified as *subjects* of assertions, using the **rdf:about** attributes. You could say that they\u2019re the \u201csubjects of *Descriptions* of them\u201d. Each has a unique URI. Then, an assertion of the following nature is made about the channel:\n\n> The channel *http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/xml* contains an *ordered sequence* of things, namely *http:\/\/www\u2026#tech\/moz-tab-bookmark and http:\/\/www\u2026#tech\/google-idempotent*.\n\nIf the RSS file were to have an image, it would occur as in other RSS versions (i.e. as an element peer of the <channel\/> element), and the <image\/> element itself would have an **rdf:about** attribute pointing to that image resource\u2019s URI. Then, *inside the channel element*, there\u2019d be a simple:\n\n> <image rdf:resource=\"...\" \/>\n\nelement pointing to the same URI as the <image\/> element\u2019s **rdf:about** attribute pointed to. This would say:\n\n> The channel *http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/xml* has an *image *, namely *(the image\u2019s URI)*.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIn other words, the RDF in RSS is there to **identify** resources (the nodes) and to **describe** properties of or relationships between them (the arcs). The RDF content of RSS is not large. I think some people might intermingle RDF and namespace content and think \u201cooh, there\u2019s a lot of RDF in RSS\u201d. Sure, namespaces are fundamental to RDF, but exist (both here in RSS and elsewhere) independent of it (although if you *use* namespaces such as the Dublin Core in RDF-enhanced RSS, then you\u2019re effectively, and at no extra cost, adding to the data web with the triples that come into being because of how RDF, namespaces, and XML wonderfully work together).\n\nSo, there you have it. Just a bit of a brain dump of what I\u2019ve been learning over the past couple of days. Now that I understand what\u2019s going on, I for one would be very disappointed to see RDF go away from RSS. Although there are signs that this may not be the case after all. But that\u2019s another story.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Ironically, it&#8217;s only been the recent and ongoing hubbub about the direction of RSS that&#8217;s got me wondering what the real truth is about the RDF in RSS.

If we didn&#8217;t have this special construction, we&#8217;d have to write:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\"&gt;\n  &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/rss\/1.0\/channel\" \/&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;DJ's Weblog&lt;\/title&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;\/rdf:Description&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>which is a tad long winded. Similarly, the long winded equivalent for the FOAF example would look like this:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;rdf:Description rdf:ID=\"qmacro\"&gt;\n  &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/Person\" \/&gt;\n  &lt;foaf:mbox rdf:resource=\"mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com\"\/&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;\/rdf:Description&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>So there you have it. The rdf:Description isn&#8217;t there because a special construction is being used in both examples.

It may be obvious to you, but I\u2019ve been struggling to see what the theme was that lay beyond the clutter of the investigations into RDF and RSS, the [contemplation of namespaces](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2002\/09\/more-thoughts-to-ponder\/) and the various recent discussions on namespaces in comments to posts on [Ben\u2019s](http:\/\/rss.benhammersley.com\/), [Shelley\u2019s](http:\/\/weblog.burningbird.net\/), [Sam\u2019s](http:\/\/www.intertwingly.net\/blog), and doubtless others\u2019 weblogs (all too much to keep track of).\n\nI\u2019d been contemplating what a namespace-aware XML parser for [RSS 1.0](http:\/\/www.purl.org\/rss\/1.0\/ \"RSS (RDF Site Summary)\") would look like, and how it would work in relation to the [RSS modules](http:\/\/web.resource.org\/rss\/1.0\/modules\/). (Of course for Perl programmers, for example, there\u2019s the [XML::RSS](http:\/\/search.cpan.org\/author\/EISEN\/XML-RSS-0.96\/RSS.pm) parser on CPAN, which is namespace aware but relies on the RSS 1.0 namespace being the *default* namespace \u2014 in other words, if you specify a prefix for the RSS 1.0 namespace, say, \u201crss10\u2033, rather than have it as the default namespace in the document, and prefix the RSS 1.0 elements with this prefix (\u201crss10:channel\u201d, \u201crss10:item\u201d, etc) then XML::RSS isn\u2019t going to like it. But I digress\u2026)\n\nWhile namespace-aware XML parsing is indeed important, and namespaces are fundamental to RDF, the importance of handling namespaces correctly when parsing had clouded a question that I knew existed but hadn\u2019t all the right words in the sentence, until now.\n\n\u201cWhat is the significance of RDF in RSS?\u201d Actually, that\u2019s not quite right.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve been looking at [the RDF in RSS](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2002\/09\/the-rdf-in-rss\/), I\u2019ve been concentrating on the bits that \u2018look like\u2019 RDF \u2014 the stuff that I highlighted in bold in the [example RSS](..\/..\/2002\/Sep\/08#tech\/rdf\/rssrdf) (rdf:about, rdf:Seq, and so on). But it\u2019s not as if there are some \u2018bits\u2019 of RDF in a format that\u2019s RSS \u2026 the format RSS 1.0 *is* an RDF application. In other words, *all* of RSS 1.0 is RDF. The fact that it\u2019s very similar to non-RDF RSS formats like 0.91 is of course an intended advantage. And the fact that the \u2018transportable form\u2019 that RDF takes is XML (RDF can be expressed in node\/arc diagrams, or other forms such as [Notation 3](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/10\/swap\/Primer.html), or \u2018N3\u2032) also makes it nicely \u2018compatible\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d, I hear you ask.\n\nWell, I\u2019ve been wondering how complicated an XML parser (yes, a namespace aware one, but that\u2019s not significant here) would have to get to support the plethora of RSS 1.0 modules available now and in the future. To be more specific, let\u2019s take an example. Consider the **creator** property (element) from the [Dublin Core (dc)](http:\/\/purl.org\/rss\/1.0\/modules\/dc\/) module. The property is normally used by specifying a literal (a string) as its value, thus:\n\n<dc:creator>DJ Adams<\/dc:creator>\n\nBut what about [rich content model](http:\/\/web.resource.org\/rss\/1.0\/modules\/#s3.2) usage of properties? Consider the use of this property in the [discussions](http:\/\/rss.benhammersley.com\/archives\/001391.html#001391) of how to splice [FOAF](http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/) with RSS. Dealing with a new element from a defined namespace, where the usage is of the *open tag \u2013 literal value \u2013 close tag* variety, is not that difficult when parsing based on XML events. But what about this, which is based on one of the suggestions from Dan Brickley in the discussion and further discussed [on the rdfweb-dev list](http:\/\/groups.yahoo.com\/group\/rdfweb-dev\/message\/293)\n\n:\n\n<dc:creator> <foaf:Person> <foaf:Name>DJ Adams<\/foaf:Name> <foaf:seeAlso rdf:resource='...' \/> ... <\/foaf:Person> <\/dc:creator>\n\nSuddenly having to parsing this, as opposed to the simple \u2018literal value\u2019 example, is a whole new ballgame in state management (\u201cwhere the hell am I *now* in this XML document and what do I do with these tags?\u201d), and at least for this author, writing an XML parser to cope with all such data eventualities would be rather difficult in the context of XML-event based parsing.\n\nBut that\u2019s just it. Considering an *XML* parser is missing the point. An *RDF* parser is more appropriate here. Looking at the structure of RSS 1.0 and the modules available for it from an RDF point of view suddenly made things clear for me. With RDF, the [striped](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/10\/stripes\/) nature of the information encoded in XML is neatly parsed, regardless of difficult-to-predict hierarchical complexity, and translated into a flat set of triples (subject, predicate, object) that you can then interrogate. What you do with that information is then up to you.\n\nThere are many RDF tools, including parsers, listed on [Dave Beckett\u2019s](http:\/\/www.purl.org\/net\/dajobe\/) [RDF resource site](http:\/\/www.ilrt.bristol.ac.uk\/discovery\/rdf\/resources\/). One of them is [Redland](http:\/\/www.redland.opensource.ac.uk\/), his own RDF toolset. Just before I bring this post to a conclusion, let\u2019s have a look at what the RDF parser in Redland produces for the two **creator** examples earlier.\n\nSimple literal value example gives:\n\n{[http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro], [http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/1.1\/elements\/creator], \"DJ Adams\"}\n\nIn other words:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \/--------\u00a0 creator\u00a0\u00a0 +----------+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | qmacro |----------->| DJ Adams | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 --------\/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +----------+\n\nComplex FOAF element structure example gives:\n\n{[http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro], [http:\/\/dublincore.com\/creator], (genid1)} {(genid1), [http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/02\/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type], [http:\/\/foaf.com\/Person]} {(genid1), [http:\/\/foaf.com\/name], \"DJ Adams\"} {(genid1), [http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/01\/rdf-schema#seeAlso], [http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/~dj\/foaf.rdf]}\n\nIn other words:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 type\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \/-------- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +-------------->| Person | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 --------\/ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \/--------\u00a0 creator\u00a0\u00a0 \/----------\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 name\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +----------+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | qmacro |----------->|\u00a0 genid1\u00a0 |------------->| DJ Adams | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 --------\/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ----------\/\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +----------+ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \/---------- \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 +-------------->| foaf.rdf | \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 seeAlso\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ----------\/\n\n(Whee!

This morning, I\u2019ve been considering the thoughts surrounding the **rdf:about** attribute in the channel element:\n\n<channel rdf:about=\"...\"> ... <\/channel>\n\nWhat should the value of the **rdf:about** be? The URI of the RSS file itself or the URI of the document that the RSS is describing? This is not a new question \u2013 it\u2019s been debated already, and I\u2019m not trying to dredge up the issues in any particular way now; I just want to get my (seemingly random) thoughts down here (weblogging for me is a great framework in which to marshall my thinking, which I\u2019m trying to make the most of in this period of infrequent connectivity).\n\nThere are some arguments for the value of **rdf:about** to be the URI of HTML document (I\u2019m using HTML examples in this post for simplicity\u2019s sake), and others for it to be the URI of the RSS document itself. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking:\n\n*Thoughts against the value being the RSS URI:*\n\n- In every case that I\u2019ve seen, the URI for the RSS data and the URI for the HTML are different. There are two separate documents. If the value of **rdf:about** is the RSS URI, what is going to describe the HTML URI?\n- There have been arguments put forward that the RSS and the HTML that it described are really just two representations of the same thing. But I thought it was Not Good Practice to identify a single resource (the thing) with two (or more) different URIs? [On the other hand, if RSS was retrieved via content negotiation, we *could* use a single URI and just state in the HTTP request that we wanted (to **Accept**) the data or the metadata.]\n- If RSS \u2018is just another representation\u2019 of the HTML, and RSS is RDF, does it follow that all RDF descriptions of single URIs are to be considered as just other representations of said URIs? (This is clearly extreme and provocative)\n\n*Thoughts in favour of the value being the RSS URI:*\n\n- Some RSS documents exist without any equivalent \u2018describee\u2019. For example, RSS feeds of aggregated items related by category are automatically constructed for further consumption. There are no equivalent HTML documents that these RSS documents are describing. So having to specify a URI of the HTML in the **rdf:about** attribute in these cases doesn\u2019t make sense.\n- Often HTML pages have content above and beyond the news (or whatever) items being described in the RSS. As the RSS is not describing this other content, stating that the description is about the HTML URI is not entirely accurate, or at least not entirely representative.\n\nOne interesting thing to note concerning the \u2018representation\u2019 question, and in relation to the HTML <link rel=\u201d\u2026\u201d \u2026 \/> construction to\n\n1. [point to the RSS feed from a weblog](..\/..\/2002\/Jun\/03#newlinks) (in collaborative weblog activities earlier this year)\n2. [point to RDF from HTML in general](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/1999\/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222\/) (in the RDF M&S)\n\nis that different possible values for the <link>\u2019s **type** attribute show both alternatives: for example the value \u201calt\u201d suggests an *alternative representation*, whereas the value \u201chome\u201d suggests a *separate resource altogether*\n\n.\n\nRegarding the content negotiation comments, and the HTTP headers that are employed, I am reminded of other thoughts about RDF and resources in general. A question I had (well, still have) is \u201c*Where are the statements about the statements?*\u201d Yes, I guess I\u2019m talking about reification, but not in the specific technical sense. I\u2019m more interested in this: given a resource, how do I know where the (RDF) statements are that describe it? [Appendix B \u201cTransporting RDF](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/1999\/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222\/#transport) in the RDF Model and Syntax (M&S) Specification describes four ways of associating descriptions with the resource they describe \u2013 \u201cembedded\u201d, \u201calong-with\u201d, \u201cservice bureau\u201d, and \u201cwrapped\u201d. I\u2019ve been thinking of the pros and cons of supplying an HTTP header when the resource is retrieved, like this:\n\nX-RDF: (URI-of-RDF-file)\n\nNow this isn\u2019t a statement about a statement in the RDF sense, but it sure tells you where the statements about a resource are to be found. Hmmm\u2026\n\nAnyway, back to what the value of **rdf:about** should be. I think the difficulties and questions arise because of the special relationship between RDF and RSS that I [mentioned last time](..\/..\/2002\/Oct\/02#tech\/rss\/significance). Perhaps because other (non-RDF) RSS formats exist, the RDF and RSS are seen as separate things, so the RSS is a valid candidate for description (by RDF). This becomes meta meta data \u2013 a description of the description. Hmmm. One perverse extrapolation of this (taking the fact that [RSS](http:\/\/www.purl.org\/rss\/1.0\/ \"RSS (RDF Site Summary)\")*is* RDF, and considering **rdf:about**=\u201dURI-of-RSS\u201d) is that all RDF files would be written to describe themselves, and not the actual original resource. Perhaps what I\u2019m trying to say is that this crazy scenario is an argument against having the RSS URI in the **rdf:about**.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the answer?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is a definitive one, apart from \u201cwhatever makes more sense for your particular instance\u201d.

What\u2019s the semantic difference between specifying the RSS URI for **rdf:about** in an RSS file, and specifying blank (i.e. **rdf:about=\u201d\u201d**)?

Let me know when someone says something about book X&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>So I whipped up a little script, <a href=\"\/~dj\/2003\/01\/booktalk\">booktalk<\/a>, which indeed uses <a href=\"http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/\">allconsuming.net<\/a>&#8216;s hooks to build a new service. What <a href=\"\/~dj\/2003\/01\/booktalk\">booktalk<\/a> does, crontabbed on an hourly basis, is to grab a user&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/soap-client.cgi?currently_reading=1&amp;username=avalon\">currently reading<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/soap-client.cgi?favorite_books=1&amp;username=qmacro\">favourite books<\/a> lists and then look at the  <a href=\"http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/soap-client.cgi?hourly=1\">hourly list<\/a> of latest books mentioned. Any intersections are pushed onto the top of a list of items in an <acronym title=\"RDF Site Summary\">RSS<\/acronym> file, which represents a sort of <a href=\"..\/..\/..\/%7Edj\/booktalk_avalon.xml\">&#8216;commentary alert&#8217; feed<\/a> for that user and his books. It goes without saying that the point of this is so that the user can easily monitor new comments on books in his collection by subscribing to that feed, which, aggregated by  <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/%7Erael\/lang\/perl\/blagg\">Blagg<\/a> and rendered by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.raelity.org\/apps\/blosxom\">Blosxom<\/a>, would look <a href=\"\/cgi-bin\/blosxom\/booktalk\">something like this<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the usual caveats apply &#8211; it&#8217;s experimental, and works for me, your mileage may vary.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 20 Jan 2003 23:54:15 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 20 Jan 2003 23:54:15 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 20 Jan 2003 23:54:15 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":280,"title":"The universal canvas and RSS apps","slug":"the-universal-canvas-and-rss-apps-2","markdown":"\nIt seems that beyond carrying syndication information, <acronym title=\"Rich Site Summary\">RSS<\/acronym> is a very useful and flexible way to get all sorts of application data pushed to a user over time.

(I had to [patch](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/Wishlist.pm.diff.txt) the module very slightly because of a problem with the user agent string not being set).\n\nThe script I wrote, [wishlist](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/wishlist), simply outputs a list of ISBN\/ASINs and title\/author details, like this:\n\n[dj@cicero scraps]$ .\/wishlist 0751327824 The Forgotten Arts and Crafts by John Seymour 090498205X With Ammon Wrigley in Saddleworth by Sam Seville 0672322404 Mod_perl Developer's Cookbook by Geoffrey Young, et al 0465024750 Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of ... 0765304368 Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow ...\n\n*Interacting with AllConsuming*\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure the [allconsuming.net](http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/) site and services are going to morph as services are added and changed, I nevertheless couldn\u2019t reist writing a very simple Perl class, [Allconsuming::Agent](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/Agent.pm) that allows you to log in (*logIn()*) and add books to your collection (*addToFavouriteBooks()*, *addToCurrentlyReading()*). It\u2019s very basic but does the job for now. It tries to play nice by logging you out (*logOut()*) of the site automatically when you\u2019ve finished. It can also tell if the site knows about a certain book (*knowsBook()*) \u2013 I think AllConsuming uses [amazon.com](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/) to look books up and so the discrepancies between that and [www.amazon.co.uk](http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/), for example, show themselves as AllConsuming\u2019s innocent blankness with certain ISBNs.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m prepared for the eventuality that things will change at [allconsuming.net](http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/) sooner or later, so this class won\u2019t work forever\u2026but it\u2019s fine for now.\n\n*Adding my wishlisted books*\n\nSo putting this all together, I wrote a driver script, [acadd](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/acadd), which grabs my current reading list data from AllConsuming, and reads in a list of ISBN\/ASINs that would be typically produced from a script like [wishlist](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/wishlist).\n\nReading through the wishlist book data, [acadd](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/acadd) does this:\n\n- checks to make sure the book isn\u2019t in my AllConsuming collection already\n- checks that AllConsuming knows about the book\n- adds the book to my collection at AllConsuming\n\nHere\u2019s a snippet of what actually happened when I piped the output of the one script into the other:\n\n[dj@cicero scraps]$ .\/wishlist | .\/acadd 0751327824 The Forgotten Arts and Crafts by John Se...

During last year\u2019s, I had [hacked](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2002\/05\/the-panopticon\/) [around](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2002\/05\/jabber-browsing-the-panopticon-data\/) with the Panopticon, creating a sort of [Jabber](http:\/\/www.jabber.org\/)-based information diffusion service to lighten the load on the Panopticon mechanism\u2019s single source socket.\n\nWith all the talk of lightening the load from RSS consumers, my thoughts turned from these Panopticon experiments to NNTP, as of course it\u2019s a technology that is designed for information diffusion, and bearing and sharing load. I couldn\u2019t resist a bit of tinkering with NNTP, partly to follow up a little bit myself on RSS to\/via NNTP, but mostly in fact to re-acquaint myself with the wonderfully arcane configuration of the majestic beast that is [inn](http:\/\/www.isc.org\/products\/INN\/). In addition, there\u2019s been talk recently of aggregators moving out of the realms of satellite applications and into the browser itself.

It also means, however, that such a \u2018collective\u2019 newsgroup is going to be less useful for diffusion and load sharing as it\u2019s specific to one (or a few) person\u2019s [feed](\/~dj\/rss.rss) tastes.<\/dd><dt>Send items from each weblog to a separate newsgroup<\/dt><dd>While the \u2018aggregation effect\u2019 is still available (by using the newsreader\u2019s \u201cread next unread\u201d function, which will normally jump from one newsgroup to the next), it\u2019s not as in-your-face. However, with a single newsgroup for each RSS feed, there are tremendous possibilities for NNTP peer exchange of (RSS weblog item) articles and consequently load sharing in the consumption of RSS \u2013 because picking and choosing feeds remains possible at the right (newsgroup) granular level. That said, this approach doesn\u2019t exclude the possibility of composite newsgroups which consisted of, say, finance news feeds, or feeds in similar categories, which would be interesting to more than one person.<\/dd><\/dl>After deliberation of such matters, I then wrote a very simple plugin for [Blagg](http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/%7Erael\/lang\/perl\/blagg), which would post each weblog item to one or more newsgroups. For my purposes, I solved the question of what to call each newsgroup by using the \u2018nickname\u2019, required for each feed, in Blagg\u2019s **rss.dat** file which controls the aggregation activity.\n\n![Screenshot of Mozilla newsreader reading aggregated RSS items](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/nntp.png \"viewing aggregated RSS-sourced news in the HTML-capable Mozilla newsreader\")\n\nThe plugin is called [nntp](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/nntp.pl). I modified Blagg slightly so it would pass the nickname to the plugin. My version of Blagg 0+4i is [here](\/~dj\/2003\/01\/blagg.0+4i) (it has a number of other modifications too). Feel free to take the plugin and modify it to suit your purpose. It was only a bit of twiddling, but it seems to work.\n\nThere are plenty of possibilities for experimentation: combining the various [weblog trackbacking mechanisms](http:\/\/www.benhammersley.com\/archives\/003862.html#003862) with NNTP article IDs to link articles together in a thread; replying (to the newsgroup) to an article might send a comment to the post at the source weblog.

That said, this approach doesn&#8217;t exclude the  possibility of composite newsgroups which consisted of, say, finance news feeds, or feeds in similar categories, which would be interesting to more than one person.<\/p>\n<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<p>After deliberation of such matters, I then wrote a very simple plugin for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/%7Erael\/lang\/perl\/blagg\">Blagg<\/a>, which  would post each weblog item to one or more newsgroups. For my purposes, I  solved the question of what to call each newsgroup by using the &#8216;nickname&#8217;, required for each feed, in Blagg&#8217;s <strong>rss.dat<\/strong> file which controls the aggregation activity.<\/p>\n<p><img title=\"viewing aggregated RSS-sourced news in the HTML-capable Mozilla newsreader\" src=\"\/~dj\/2003\/01\/nntp.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Mozilla newsreader reading aggregated RSS items\" width=\"664\" height=\"318\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The plugin is called <a href=\"\/~dj\/2003\/01\/nntp.pl\">nntp<\/a>.

Rather like conneg and weblogs, perhaps.  <acronym title=\"Rich Site Summary\">RSS<\/acronym> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/%7Erael\/lang\/perl\/blagg\">aggregators<\/a> might not start doing conneg until weblog RSS content is available by that  method, and there&#8217;s little incentive if no-one&#8217;s asking for it. So I thought I&#8217;d make a move. Experimental, mind you.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 22:24:41 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 22:24:41 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 28 Feb 2003 22:24:41 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":395,"title":"New Blosxom plugin 'submission'","slug":"new-blosxom-plugin-submission-2","markdown":"\nI\u2019ve just written a plugin \u2018[submission](\/~dj\/2003\/03\/submission)\u2018 which provides [Blosxom](http:\/\/www.raelity.org\/apps\/blosxom) with a mechanism for accepting content POSTed to it. I wrote it initially as a mechanism for people to submit plugin information to the [plugin registry](http:\/\/www.raelity.org\/apps\/blosxom\/plugins), but made it a bit more generic.\n\nThe idea is that you can have Blosxom accept submitted entries and treat them as \u2018pending\u2019, using a \u2018.txt-\u2018 file extension, so they\u2019re not immediately viewable in the weblog output.

And a very nice plugin it is too. It allows you to use \u2018wikiwordish\u2019 notation like [[this]] to point to other weblog entries; the plugin intercepts them and creates a suitable hyperlink to the right place. For example, I can refer to an older entry about the Tiki parser for MoinMoin by just typing the name of the entry (\u2018tikiparser\u2019) inside double square brackets; in other words, [[tikiparser]] in my weblog item source gets turned into this: [[tikiparser]].\n\nI decided to expand on this lovely idea, by adding some more functionality to the plugin. With my [expanded version of \u2018wikiwordish\u2019](\/~dj\/2003\/03\/wikiwordish) ([diff here](\/~dj\/2003\/03\/wikiwordish.diff)) it is now possible to have [InterWiki](http:\/\/twistedmatrix.com\/users\/jh.twistd\/moin\/moin.cgi\/InterWiki) style links automatically recognised and expanded too. (I also made a modification to the regex in *story()*, as it wasn\u2019t behaving quite right). So I can refer to the, say, StartingPoints page of the [MeatBall Wiki](http:\/\/www.usemod.com\/cgi-bin\/mb.pl?) by using a link in my weblog entry like this: [[MeatBall:StartingPoints]], which would be turned into a link like this: [[MeatBall:StartingPoints]].\n\nThe way it works is simple: you tell the plugin where to find an InterWiki \u2018intermap\u2019 file, which contains a list of InterWiki names and URLs. You can probably find this somewhere in your wiki installation. You can also add your own name\/URL combinations in the configuration in case you\u2019re not allowed to edit the intermap file; in my setup I\u2019ve added the name \u2018PipeSpace\u2019 to refer to my MoinMoin-powered [space](..\/..\/..\/space) Wiki (see the \u2018Configurable Variables section\u2019 in the [code](..\/..\/..\/%7Edj\/2003\/03\/wikiwordish)), so I can now create a link such as this: [[PipeSpace:AllConsumingRestIdeas]] which is turned into this: [[PipeSpace:AllConsumingRestIdeas]].

Looking at the FOAF data for various people, I was reminded of the model of indirection that is used to identify a person.\n\n<foaf:Person> <foaf:mbox>dj.adams@pobox.com<\/foaf:mbox> ... <\/foaf:Person>\n\nActually, while I think on, why not:\n\n<foaf:Person> <foaf:mbox rdf:resource=\"mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com\" \/> ... <\/foaf:Person>\n\nAnyway. The idea is that rather than refer to a person directly, we refer to them indirectly: \u201c*The person with the email address dj.adams@pobox.com*\u201c. Why do this? Well, for one thing, an email address is a fairly unambiguous property \u2014 there\u2019s usually the same person consistently to be found behind an email address. The FOAF [spec](http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/index.html) uses [DAML](http:\/\/www.daml.org\/ \"DAML: DARPA Agent Markup Language\") to annotate the mbox property as being unambiguous (you can see this in the [RDF version of the spec](http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/index.rdf)).\n\nIn the arcs and nodes world of RDF, it would look something like this:\n\n +----------+ +---| | | +----------+ mbox | | V +---------------------------+ | mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com | +---------------------------+\n\nThe box at the top represents the person, and is a blank node, in that it doesn\u2019t have a (direct) identifier. The uniqueness is *indirect*\n\n.\n\nThen I came across [Mark Baker\u2019s FOAF file](http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca\/foaf.rdf), which starts:\n\n<foaf:Person rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca\/\"> <foaf:name>Mark Baker<\/foaf:name> ...\n\nWhat\u2019s this? Does this mean that the HTTP URI [http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca](http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca\/) represents Mark? (What does \u201crepresents Mark\u201d mean anyway?) We know about [REST](http:\/\/internet.conveyor.com\/RESTwiki\/moin.cgi\/FrontPage \"The REST Wiki's front page\"), and *representations* of *resources* that can be retrieved via HTTP URIs. If I specify a MIME type of \u2018text\/html\u2019 when asking for a representation of the resource at that URI, I am sent some HTML (Mark\u2019s home page). I wonder what MIME type I\u2019d have to specify to get Mark himself disassembled into IP packets and reassembled next to my laptop? Of course, before you say anything, this is one of the differences between URIs and URLs, and I won\u2019t expect to see Mark any time soon :-) Plus, there\u2019s the concept of identity which must stand alone from the concept of resources and representations \u2026 if Mark comes down the wire, am I getting a representation of Mark, or Mark in person? At least I might get a picture of him if I specify \u2018image\/*\u2019.\n\nIn any case, Mark does assert that the URI does identify him, the person. Very interesting. Mark pointed me to an [item](http:\/\/norman.walsh.name\/2003\/06\/06\/karma \"assigning URIs to people\") on Norman Walsh\u2019s weblog which touches on this subject.\n\nSo, what does, or could, an HTTP URI represent? Leigh Dodds recently expressed a desire to detail aspects of [his life in RDF](http:\/\/www.ldodds.com\/blog\/archives\/000050.html) (and I like the idea of the Semantic Web\u2019s \u201cyear zero\u201d that he mentions). Films he\u2019s seen, books he\u2019s reading, and so on. Great!, I thought, and immediately perused [Erik Benson](http:\/\/erikbenson.com\/)\u2018s [allconsuming.net](http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/) API documentation (there\u2019s a [RESTful way of getting the book data](http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/news\/000042.html) too, now) \u2013 I could pull out the data from there and construct some RDF statements about the CurrentlyReading book information.\n\nBut before I started, I went all philosophical and thought about representations and abstractions for a bit; at least, as much as my limited knowledge would allow. I\u2019d been thinking that the currently reading information might come out like this:\n\n<foaf:Person> <foaf:mbox rdf:resource='mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com' \/> <books:currentlyReading rdf:resource='http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/item.cgi?isbn=0596002025' \/> ...\n\nBut surely that says that I\u2019m currently reading *the allconsuming.net page for that book*, not that book itself? It\u2019s not a question of unique identity, as the ISBN in the URI disambiguates. It\u2019s a question of what the URI represents. How do you refer to the book itself \u2014 the abstraction (funny how \u2018abstract\u2019 actually means \u2018real\u2019 here)? Perhaps here, as in FOAF, a level of indirection could be used:\n\n<foaf:Person> <foaf:mbox rdf:resource='mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com' \/> <books:currentlyReading> <books:Book> <books:describedAt rdf:resource='http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/item.cgi?isbn=0596002025' \/> ... <\/books:Book> ...\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m currently reading *the book that\u2019s described at that allconsuming.net page*. Seems fair. And this is what it looks like:\n\n +----- Person | ------ +-------+ +-----| |----+ | +-------+ | mbox | | | | V | currentlyReading +---------------------------+ | | mailto:dj.adams@pobox.com | | +---------------------------+ | +----- Book V | ---- +-------+ +----| | | +-------+ describedAt | | V +--------------------------------------------------+ | http:\/\/allconsuming.net\/item.cgi?isbn=0596002025 | +--------------------------------------------------+\n\nOn the subject of identification and HTTP URIs, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a paper [\u201cWhat do HTTP URIs Identify?\u201d](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/DesignIssues\/HTTP-URI.html) where he discusses various angles on the difficulty regarding resources, identification and the real world. The paper refers to, and stems from, discussion on this in the [httpRange-14](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/tag\/ilist#httpRange-14) issue in the [TAG issues list](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/tag\/ilist).\n\nIn the book diagram above, I\u2019ve included little class annotations for each of the two blank nodes (Person and Book). I wonder if, at least in RDF, classes can be used effectively to draw a distinction between Mark Baker and his home page? In other words, the snippet of Mark\u2019s FOAF data:\n\n<foaf:Person rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca\/\"> <foaf:name>Mark Baker<\/foaf:name> ...\n\nwhich is really shorthand for:\n\n<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca\/\"> <rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/Person\" \/> <foaf:name>Mark Baker<\/foaf:name> ...\n\nsays that the resource at http:\/\/www.markbaker.ca is a Person.\n\nBy the way, Mark is not alone in identifying himself, a person, with an HTTP URI. The [RDF Primer](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/2002\/WD-rdf-primer-20020319\/) does the same thing in an example (this time in N-Triple format):\n\n<http:\/\/www.example.org\/index.html> <http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/creator> <http:\/\/www.example.org\/staffid\/85740> .\n\nThis says that the document at http:\/\/www.example.org\/staffid\/87540 created the document at http:\/\/www.example.org\/index.html.\n\nOr does it?\n\n\n","html":"<p>Coming back from a short break from the tech world recently, I started to reacquaint myself with <a title=\"FOAF: Friend Of A Friend Vocab\" href=\"http:\/\/xmlns.com\/foaf\/0.1\/\">FOAF<\/a> and <a title=\"RDF (Resource Description Framework)\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/RDF\/\">RDF<\/a>, amongst other things.

SAP have been selling enterprise level software for a very long time. And one of the key selling points was that the data, and the business processes, were *integrated*.

It wasn\u2019t directly to point out the about-turn SAP seem to be making in this area. It was actually to point out the juxtaposition that SAP\u2019s new de-integrated direction has with \u2026 their vision for front-ends. While de-integration is where it\u2019s at on the server side, we have *total integration* on the client side. Enterprise Portal (EP) 6.0, WebDynpro, PeopleCentric design (don\u2019t get me started on that) \u2013 every function that a user might need is lumped together in one homogenised \u201cweb\u201d client. Email, discussion groups, graphics, reports, transactions, IM, and so on. All on one page in your browser. What happened to \u2018best of breed\u2019 on the desktop? I\u2019m a great believer in the right tools for each job. That\u2019s why I run a proper email client (for email and threaded forum-style discussions), a separate IM client, a separate newsreader, and a browser. Each one excels in its own domain.

A single screen looking extremely busy with lots of little application windows, flashing lights, tables, graphics, and so on, is *great* for screenshots and brochures. But what about the real end user? I\u2019m an end user as well as a developer, and can imagine productivity taking a huge dive if we were forced to use this.\n\nOf course, the browser-based applications served from the EP are a lot different from what I imagine browser based applications to be.

A move to using <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060313005353\/http:\/\/www.moveabletype.org\/\">Moveable Type<\/a> as a shrinkwrapped piece of commodity software seemed like a good idea. I like tinkering as much as the next person, but I think we&#8217;ve reached a level where certain applications should &#8216;just work&#8217; &#8211; after all, I don&#8217;t worry how Apache works inside (much), why should I spend time hacking on blogging software? I should just <em>write<\/em>. Moreover, fewer Internet cafes offer anything more than web access, so I need a web-based front end to things more and more (I&#8217;m still holding on to <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060313005353\/http:\/\/www.mutt.org\/\">Mutt<\/a> for now, though).<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060313005353\/http:\/\/se71.org\/blog\">Robert<\/a> had recently started using MT, so I thought I&#8217;d give it a go. I tried <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060313005353\/http:\/\/www.wordpress.org\/\">WordPress<\/a> too. WordPress was a breeze to install and get going with &#8211; 10 minutes all told. But it didn&#8217;t seem to have &#8216;proper&#8217; RSS (1.0) [Later: I found Morten talking about <a href=\"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20060313005353\/http:\/\/www.wasab.dk\/morten\/blog\/archives\/2004\/05\/20\/improving-rss-output-from-wordpress\">how to turn RSS 1.0 on<\/a>], and I couldn&#8217;t immediately use it with some other software and applications I had in mind. MT was more of a pain. I just about managed it in an hour, but that involved looking at Perl code, tailing server logs, and lots of head scratching. Not very impressive. But now it&#8217;s running, I&#8217;m happy.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 18 Feb 2005 08:43:20 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 18 Feb 2005 08:43:20 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 18 Feb 2005 08:43:20 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":527,"title":"ClaphamJunction2","slug":"claphamjunction2","markdown":"\n[![ClaphamJunction2](http:\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/5\/4954887_dae11bc094_t.jpg \"Clapham Junction\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/4954887\/ \"ClaphamJunction2 by qmacro, on Flickr\")I spend a lot of time at Clapham Junction.

Yes \u2013 open source and free software!\n\nSAP\u2019s dominance of the business software market combined with the sheer size and momentum of the company and its developers sometimes make it hard for those inside to see the reality outside. So I can understand why statements like those of Agassi and Kagermann are made.\n\nNevertheless, it makes me sad to think that they\u2019re perhaps forgetting the enormous cooking pot, the catalyst, that is the ABAP language and the business applications that have been delivered, in an open source fashion (the source is available to see and modify), to customers for the past decade or so. Both SAP developers and SAP customers have benefitted from this cooking pot; the former due to [Linus\u2019s law](http:\/\/www.catb.org\/~esr\/writings\/cathedral-bazaar\/cathedral-bazaar\/ar01s04.html) (\u201cgiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\u201d), and the latter due to the fact that customers can learn from, build upon, and fix code delivered from SAP.\n\nAnyway, let\u2019s see where this debate leads. SAP\u2019s stance on open source is one thing; the stance on IP and software patents in Europe (read to the end of the article to find out what I\u2019m referring to) is something else entirely more worrying. Come on chaps, do we really want a patent system that\u2019s as ridiculously messed up as the one in the U.S.?\n\n**Update:**[Frank K](http:\/\/www.gadgetguy.de\/index.php\/2005\/05#SAP__PHP_just_for_college_students_) looks at the quote differently, and also mentions SAP\u2019s involvement with Zend. Of course, this is one of many initiatives (MaxDB and contributions by SAP\u2019s [LinuxLab](http:\/\/www.sap.com\/linux) to the GNU\/Linux kernel to name a couple of others) that SAP are undertaking. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the reason why I was so shocked is that it was such a left-of-centre stance all of a sudden. I\u2019ve [defended SAP\u2019s open source initiatives](https:\/\/weblogs.sdn.sap.com\/cs\/user\/view\/cs_msg\/258) in the past, and I\u2019ll do it again.\n\nIn all, I\u2019m still quite confounded by the implication that open source is for students and not for \u2018serious\u2019 software. In our SAP landscape, we have *major* SAP-powered applications that are written in Perl (with Apache, running on Linux). Perhaps it\u2019s me. I dunno. Time for a beer.

Both SAP developers and SAP customers have benefitted from this cooking pot; the former due to <a href='http:\/\/www.catb.org\/~esr\/writings\/cathedral-bazaar\/cathedral-bazaar\/ar01s04.html'>Linus&#8217;s law<\/a> (&#8220;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&#8221;), and the latter due to the fact that customers can learn from, build upon, and fix code delivered from SAP. <\/p>\n<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s see where this debate leads. SAP&#8217;s stance on open source is one thing; the stance on IP and software patents in Europe (read to the end of the article to find out what I&#8217;m referring to) is something else entirely more worrying. Come on chaps, do we really want a patent system that&#8217;s as ridiculously messed up as the one in the U.S.?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> <a href='http:\/\/www.gadgetguy.de\/index.php\/2005\/05#SAP__PHP_just_for_college_students_'>Frank K<\/a> looks at the quote differently, and also mentions SAP&#8217;s involvement with Zend. Of course, this is one of many initiatives (MaxDB and contributions by SAP&#8217;s <a href='http:\/\/www.sap.com\/linux'>LinuxLab<\/a> to the GNU\/Linux kernel to name a couple of others) that SAP are undertaking. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; the reason why I was so shocked is that it was such a left-of-centre stance all of a sudden. I&#8217;ve <a href='https:\/\/weblogs.sdn.sap.com\/cs\/user\/view\/cs_msg\/258'>defended SAP&#8217;s open source initiatives<\/a> in the past, and I&#8217;ll do it again. <\/p>\n<p>In all, I&#8217;m still quite confounded by the implication that open source is for students and not for &#8216;serious&#8217; software.

To be honest, the thinking has been triggered by frustration at the nuts and bolts of SAP technical matters, particularly in the area of service support and basis work.\n\nSAP found success with R\/2 and R\/3 for many reasons, one of which was abstraction. Because they wanted to offer a set of uniform facilities across a range of vastly different platforms, they built abstractions for basic services such as jobs (background processing), spooling, process and session management, database access, and so on. These abstractions, these inventions of layers on top of OS-level services contributed a great deal to the success of SAP implementations.\n\nHowever, this culture of abstraction, combined with decades of being *the* original and best wall-to-wall ERP software solution, is causing problems since SAP started the long process of shaking off its monolith mantle and starting to compete and coexist more with the rest of the software world, and the internet (most particularly the web). SAP are used to designing, building and delivering things on their own terms, according to their own culture, and based on their view of the rest of the world. The problem is, the tech world in which SAP deliver software and services today is vastly different to what it was ten or twenty years ago, and SAP\u2019s size is making it difficult for them to adapt quickly enough.\n\nLet\u2019s take the web as an example (which clearly didn\u2019t exist then, but has for a good while now). And within the web example, let\u2019s take a bread and butter service \u2013 [OSS Notes](http:\/\/service.sap.com\/notes), within the larger context of the service portal. Essentially, an OSS note is a document that describes a particular issue, typically with Symptom, Cause, Solution and other sections (including links to software corrections). Pretty straightforward. An OSS note has versions, a status, belongs to an application area, and has other data associated with it, but can be essentially represented as a web page.\n\nThe power of the web is vast, but how that power is presented is subtle. Hyperlinks, addressing (URLs), reliable navigation, and so on. And at the user end, we have the UI (the browser) that contains basic but important tools such as bookmarking, browsing history, and simple features like showing what the address of a hyperlink is when you hover over it.\n\nBut what SAP has done in implementing OSS notes on the web (they were previously only available on an SAP system that you had to connect to with SAPGUI) shows all the signs of the abstraction (re-invention) culture, and the struggle SAP still has in embracing the rest of the world.\n\nFirst of all, the OSS notes are available from within the service portal, which is beset with all manner of navigation difficulties and breaks many of the cardinal rules of web design ([frames](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/23720154\/), popups and new windows, impossibly long URLs, overuse of Javascript, [pages that don\u2019t fit in your browser](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/27319450\/) even at 1024\u00d7768, but I digress \u2026 ) \u2013 in fact the most telling symptom of the portal\u2019s problems is the fact that SAP never refer to specific URLs for things in the portal, you always receive instructions such as  \n \u201c*Go to this base URL, then click here, then here, then here, then here to get what you\u2019re looking for*\u201d and of course invariably the texts and hyperlinks that you click through one month have been changed by the next month and this sort of navigation description breaks down entirely (ever tried to find a specific version of, say, SAPINST?)\n\nBut the main problem is that the OSS notes are only on the web in the letter of the law. In the spirit of the law, they\u2019re not. The frameset-induced misery means that you can\u2019t use basic browser tools to bookmark and otherwise organise OSS notes the way *you* want to. But it\u2019s even more interesting than that \u2013 on the top frame of each OSS note page, there are Javascript powered \u2018favourites\u2019 and \u2018subscribe\u2019 links. Why can\u2019t I just use the power of the web \u2013 URLs, to manage my own favourites, either in my browser, or using [external tools](http:\/\/del.icio.us)?\n\nFurthermore, even if you overlook the problems caused by overengineering \u2014 this abstraction layer of web upon web \u2014 you can\u2019t escape the fact that the machine-translation of OSS note content into HTML is beset with problems. Formatting issues mean that you soon lose your way in a long OSS note when it has nested bullet points. Also, none of the things referred to, which are available somewhere in the SAP portal, are hyperlinked (in fact, *nothing* is hyperlinked).\n\nFinally, there is actually a unique URL for each OSS note but each one is extremely long, bears no relation to the OSS note number, and isn\u2019t easy to exchange in, say, an IM\/IRC or email-based chat.\n\nYou might think I\u2019m particularly picking on OSS notes. I\u2019m not; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a tangible (and in-your-face) example of how things can go wrong when the culture of abstraction and the oil tanker-like momentum cause SAP programmers to over-engineer a solution. (And it\u2019s been [on my mind](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/archives\/2005\/07\/hacking_the_sap.html) recently too). There are plenty of other examples where SAP is unnecessarily re-inventing stuff \u2013 take SAPtutor for example \u2013 there are plenty of platform-independent ways of presenting slides, video and audio on the web. Why, then, invent yet another format that needs a special player, that\u2019s only available on a single platform? But I digress (again) \u2026\n\nSo, to the title of this post, then. Where is SAP going? They\u2019ve made good progress in opening up to the world (albeit with a number of wrong turns, in the past and more recently), but there\u2019s a lot to do. I know there\u2019s a lot to do, as I\u2019ve seen it first hand while performing some Basis activities recently, and having to use the service portal to get to where we need to be.\n\nCan SAP adapt? Can they start to embrace, rather than resist, the environments in which they find themselves today? Can they tune their complex culture (of complexity) to deliver a better service and better software?\n\nI have faith in them. But sometimes, when you\u2019re making a living as a SAP-hacking footsoldier, it\u2019s hard.\n\nUpdate:\n\nShortly after posting this, Piers wrote an [interesting followup](http:\/\/www.piersharding.com\/blog\/archives\/2005\/07\/sap_a_closed_cu.html) on how the closed culture may end in doom. Also, I spotted a well-written post by Ryan Tomayko called [Motherhood and Apple Pie](http:\/\/lesscode.org\/2005\/07\/21\/motherhood-and-apple-pie\/) today which spookily touches on the core point of this post \u2013 that SAP are resisting the very tools and technologies and design axioms that make the most scalable and widely distributed meta-application tick.\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot recently about where SAP is going and what SAP is doing today, especially in the light of where it went and what it did in the past.

The problem is, the tech world in which SAP deliver software and services today is vastly different to what it was ten or twenty years ago, and SAP&#8217;s size is making it difficult for them to adapt quickly enough.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the web as an example (which clearly didn&#8217;t exist then, but has for a good while now). And within the web example, let&#8217;s take a bread and butter service &#8211; <a href='http:\/\/service.sap.com\/notes'>OSS Notes<\/a>, within the larger context of the service portal. Essentially, an OSS note is a document that describes a particular issue, typically with Symptom, Cause, Solution and other sections (including links to software corrections). Pretty straightforward. An OSS note has versions, a status, belongs to an application area, and has other data associated with it, but can be essentially represented as a web page. <\/p>\n<p>The power of the web is vast, but how that power is presented is subtle. Hyperlinks, addressing (URLs), reliable navigation, and so on. And at the user end, we have the UI (the browser) that contains basic but important tools such as bookmarking, browsing history, and simple features like showing what the address of a hyperlink is when you hover over it. <\/p>\n<p>But what SAP has done in implementing OSS notes on the web (they were previously only available on an SAP system that you had to connect to with SAPGUI) shows all the signs of the abstraction (re-invention) culture, and the struggle SAP still has in embracing the rest of the world. <\/p>\n<p>First of all, the OSS notes are available from within the service portal, which is beset with all manner of navigation difficulties and breaks many of the cardinal rules of web design (<a href='http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/23720154\/'>frames<\/a>, popups and new windows, impossibly long URLs, overuse of Javascript, <a href='http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/27319450\/'>pages that don&#8217;t fit in your browser<\/a> even at 1024&#215;768, but I digress &#8230; ) &#8211; in fact the most telling symptom of the portal&#8217;s problems is the fact that SAP never refer to specific URLs for things in the portal, you always receive instructions such as<br \/>\n&#8220;<em>Go to this base URL, then click here, then here, then here, then here to get what you&#8217;re looking for<\/em>&#8221; and of course invariably the texts and hyperlinks that you click through one month have been changed by the next month and this sort of navigation description breaks down entirely (ever tried to find a specific version of, say, SAPINST?)<\/p>\n<p>But the main problem is that the OSS notes are only on the web in the letter of the law. In the spirit of the law, they&#8217;re not. The frameset-induced misery means that you can&#8217;t use basic browser tools to bookmark and otherwise organise OSS notes the way <em>you<\/em> want to. But it&#8217;s even more interesting than that &#8211; on the top frame of each OSS note page, there are Javascript powered &#8216;favourites&#8217; and &#8216;subscribe&#8217; links. Why can&#8217;t I just use the power of the web &#8211; URLs, to manage my own favourites, either in my browser, or using <a href='http:\/\/del.icio.us'>external tools<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if you overlook the problems caused by overengineering &#8212; this abstraction layer of web upon web &#8212; you can&#8217;t escape the fact that the machine-translation of OSS note content into HTML is beset with problems. Formatting issues mean that you soon lose your way in a long OSS note when it has nested bullet points. Also, none of the things referred to, which are available somewhere in the SAP portal, are hyperlinked (in fact, <em>nothing<\/em> is hyperlinked).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is actually a unique URL for each OSS note but each one is extremely long, bears no relation to the OSS note number, and isn&#8217;t easy to exchange in, say, an IM\/IRC or email-based chat.  <\/p>\n<p>You might think I&#8217;m particularly picking on OSS notes. I&#8217;m not; it&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s a tangible (and in-your-face) example of how things can go wrong when the culture of abstraction and the oil tanker-like momentum cause SAP programmers to over-engineer a solution. (And it&#8217;s been <a href='http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/archives\/2005\/07\/hacking_the_sap.html'>on my mind<\/a> recently too). There are plenty of other examples where SAP is unnecessarily re-inventing stuff &#8211; take SAPtutor for example &#8211; there are plenty of platform-independent ways of presenting slides, video and audio on the web. Why, then, invent yet another format that needs a special player, that&#8217;s only available on a single platform? But I digress (again) &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>So, to the title of this post, then. Where is SAP going? They&#8217;ve made good progress in opening up to the world (albeit with a number of wrong turns, in the past and more recently), but there&#8217;s a lot to do. I know there&#8217;s a lot to do, as I&#8217;ve seen it first hand while performing some Basis activities recently, and having to use the service portal to get to where we need to be. <\/p>\n<p>Can SAP adapt? Can they start to embrace, rather than resist, the environments in which they find themselves today? Can they tune their complex culture (of complexity) to deliver a better service and better software?<\/p>\n<p>I have faith in them. But sometimes, when you&#8217;re making a living as a SAP-hacking footsoldier, it&#8217;s hard. <\/p>\n<p>Update:<\/p>\n<p>Shortly after posting this, Piers wrote an <a href='http:\/\/www.piersharding.com\/blog\/archives\/2005\/07\/sap_a_closed_cu.html'>interesting followup<\/a> on how the closed culture may end in doom.

I don\u2019t have access to Tarpipe\u2019s sources, so I had to go a roundabout route. Tarpipe has a Mailer connector, which enables emails to be sent from within a workflow. So I built a very simple email-to-HTTP-POST mechanism \u2018tarbridge\u2019. This way, you can use the Mailer connector to send an email like this:\n\nRecipient: tarbridge+<token>@pipetree.com  \n Subject: the URL to POST to and an optional content-type  \n Body: the payload of the HTTP POST\n\nand an HTTP POST will be made to the URL specified. You\u2019ll even get an email reply with the HTTP response.\n\nHere\u2019s an example workflow that receives an email containing something to bookmark in Delicious. It uses the Delicious connector, and also makes an HTTP POST to a little test application (running on a local devserver version of the excellent [Google AppEngine](http:\/\/code.google.com\/appengine\/), fwiw) via tarbridge.\n\n[![Workflow using tarbridge](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/tarpipebridgetest1-300x134.jpg \"Workflow using tarbridge\")](http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/qmacro\/3470773120\/)\n\nThe Subject of the email contains the URL to make the HTTP POST to. By default the Content-Type will be set to application\/x-www-form-urlencoded, but you can override this by specifying a different content type (here I\u2019ve specified text\/plain) as a second parameter in the Subject.\n\nThe addressee of the email is \u2018tarbridge+<some token>@pipetree.com\u2019. I\u2019ve used this approach so I can control what goes through this tarbridge mechanism. A token is associated with an email address, to which the HTTP response is sent in reply.\n\nThe body of the email is what\u2019s send as the payload in the HTTP request.\n\nSo sending this email to the Tarpipe workflow above:\n\nFrom: DJ Adams <dj@pipetree.com> To: bury69xxxx@tarpipe.net Subject: http:\/\/blog.tarpipe.com Tarpipe blog\n\nresults in this Delicious entry:\n\n[![Tarpipe Blog URL on Delicious](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/04\/tarpipeblogurlondelicious-300x196.png \"Tarpipe Blog URL on Delicious\")](http:\/\/delicious.com\/url\/95948a42d8777b46278d4da333345473)\n\nand this email sent, via the Mailer connector, to the tarbridge mechanism:\n\nTo: tarbridge+token@pipetree.com Subject: http:\/\/www.pipetree.com:8888\/feed\/ text\/plain From: tarpipe mailer <mailer@tarpipe.net> http:\/\/blog.tarpipe.com http:\/\/del.icio.us\/url\/95948a42d8777b46278d4da333345473\n\nwhich in turn results in an HTTP POST being made like this:\n\nPOST \/feed\/ HTTP\/1.1 User-Agent: tarbridge\/0.1 libwww-perl\/5.812 Host: www.pipetree.com:8888 Content-Type: text\/plain [...] http:\/\/blog.tarpipe.com http:\/\/del.icio.us\/url\/95948a42d8777b46278d4da333345473\n\nThe result of the HTTP POST is emailed back like this:\n\nSubject: Re: http:\/\/www.pipetree.com:8888\/feed\/ text\/plain To: DJ Adams <dj.adams@pobox.com> From: tarbridge+token@pipetree.com\n\nHTTP\/1.0 201 Created Date: Fri, 24 Apr 2009 10:06:55 GMT Location: http:\/\/www.pipetree.com:8888\/feed\/test-feed-1\/agtmZWVkYnVpbGRlc[...] [...]\n\nSo if you were really crazy you could even feed that response back into the Tarpipe loop, using a second workflow (hmm, Tarpipe could do with a string parsing connector too :-)\n\nThe tarbridge mechanism is just a little Perl script that\u2019s triggered via [Procmail](http:\/\/www.procmail.org).

The thoughts are those that came together when I was [chatting](http:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/1782050968) to Ian Forrester ([@cubicgarden](http:\/\/twitter.com\/cubicgarden)), at a [GeekUp event](http:\/\/geekup.org\/events\/130) in Manchester last week.\n\n### Messaging Systems\n\nBack in the day, I talked about, wrote about and indeed built interconnected messaging systems based around the idea of a *message bus*, that has human, system and bot participation. The fundamental idea was based around one or more channels, rooms or groupings of messages; messages which could be originated from any participant, and likewise filtered, consumed and acted upon by any other. I wrote a [couple](http:\/\/www.openp2p.com\/pub\/a\/p2p\/2002\/01\/11\/jabber_bots.html) of [articles](http:\/\/www.openp2p.com\/pub\/a\/p2p\/2002\/02\/08\/chatbot_two.html) positing that bots might be the command line of the future.\n\nUsing my [favourite messaging protocol](http:\/\/www.xmpp.org), I built such a messaging system for an enterprise client. This system was based around a series of rooms, and had a number of small-but-perfectly-formed agents that threw information onto the message bus, information such as messages resulting from monitoring systems across the network (\u201cdisk space threshold reached\u201d, \u201cSystem X is not responding\u201d, \u201cFile received from external source\u201d, etc) and messages from SAP systems (\u201cSales Order nnn received\u201d, \u201c[Transport xxx released](https:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/7ce5c590-0201-0010-388e-cc28510abb89)\u201c, \u201cPurchase Order yyy above value z created\u201d, etc). It also had a complement of agents that listened to that [RSS\/ATOM-sourced](http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/xml\/blog\/2003\/01\/rss_the_web_service_we_already.html) stream of enterprise consciousness and acted upon messages they were designed to filter \u2014 sending an SMS message here, emailing there, re-messaging onto a different bus or system elsewhere.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Twitter? Well, Twitter is a messaging system too. And Twitter\u2019s \u2018timeline\u2019 concept is similar to the above message groupings. People, systems and bots can and do (I hesitate to say \u2018publish\u2019 and \u2018subscribe to\u2019 here) create, share and consume messages very easily.\n\n### Killer Feature\n\nBut the killer feature is that Twitter espouses the guiding design principle:\n\n[**Everything has a URL**](http:\/\/www.google.co.uk\/search?q=\"everything+has+a+url\")\n\nand everything is available via the lingua franca of today\u2019s interconnected systems \u2014 HTTP. Timelines (message groupings) have URLs. Message producers and consumers have URLs. Crucially, *individual messages have URLs* (this is why I could refer to a particular tweet at the start of this post). All the moving parts of this microblogging mechanism are [first class citizens on the web](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2002\/09\/rest-google-and-idempotency\/). Twitter exposes message data as feeds, too.\n\nEven Twitter\u2019s API, while not *entirely* RESTful, is certainly facing in the right direction, exposing information and functionality via simple URLs and readily consumable formats (XML, JSON). The [simplest thing that could possibly work](http:\/\/c2.com\/xp\/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html) usually does, enabling the \u201c[small pieces, loosely joined](http:\/\/www.smallpieces.com\/)\u201d approach that lets you [pipeline the web](http:\/\/radio.weblogs.com\/0100887\/2002\/03\/27.html), like this:\n\ndj@giant:~$ <span style=\"color: #008000;\">GET http:\/\/twitter.com\/users\/show\/qmacro.json | \u00a0perl -MJSON -e \"print from_json(<>)->{'location'},qq\/n\/\"<\/span> Manchester, England dj@giant:~$\n\nNone of this opaque, heavy and expensive SOA stuff here, thank you very much.\n\n### Other Microblogging Systems and Decentralisation\n\nAnd does this feature set apply only to Twitter? Of course not. Other microblogging systems, notably [laconi.ca](http:\/\/laconi.ca\/trac\/) \u2014 most well known for the public instance [identi.ca](http:\/\/identi.ca\/) \u2014 follow these guiding design principles too.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about laconi.ca is that just as a company that wants to keep message traffic within the enterprise can run their own mail server (SMTP) and instant messaging & presence server (Jabber\/XMPP), so also can laconi.ca be used within a company for instant and flexible enterprise social messaging, especially when combined with [enterprise RSS](http:\/\/www.oreillynet.com\/\/cs\/user\/view\/cs_msg\/12476).

This is something that I and others have been wanting for a while now, so it\u2019s great news. The [announcement](http:\/\/getsatisfaction.com\/tarpipe\/topics\/a_rest_connector#reply_1059544) was quite short and didn\u2019t have much detail. I like to see things visually, and I\u2019m guessing others do too, so I decided to write a little handler to receive a sample request from the REST connector to dump it for inspection.\n\nAs Bruno showed in the announcement, this is what the REST connector looks like:\n\n![Tarpipe REST connector](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/tarpiperestconnector.png \"Tarpipe REST connector\")\n\nIt will take whatever values it receives in the **title**, **description** and **link** input fields on the left hand side of the connector, and construct a piece of [JSON](http:\/\/www.json.org\/) which it then sends in an [application\/x-www-form-urlencoded](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/interact\/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1) format as a data=<JSON> name\/value pair in the message body of an HTTP POST request to the resource specified in the **serviceUrl** field.\n\nSo if we pass the values \u201c*DJ\u2019s Weblog*\u201d into the title, \u201c*Reserving the right to be wrong*\u201d into the description, \u201c*http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/*\u201d into the link fields, and pass \u201c*http:\/\/example.org\/bucket\/*\u201d into the serviceUrl field, the following HTTP request is made on the http:\/\/example.org\/bucket\/ resource like this:\n\nPOST \/bucket\/ HTTP\/1.1 Content-Length: 218 Content-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded Host: example.org Accept: *\/* data=%7B%22items%22%3A%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22DJ%27s+Weblog%22%2C%22description %22%3A%22Reserving+the+right+to+be+wrong%5Cn%22%2C%22link%22%3A%22http%3A %5C%2F%5C%2Fwww.pipetree.com%5C%2Fqmacro%5C%2Fblog%5C%2F%22%7D%5D%7D\n\n(whitespace added by me for readability).\n\nWhen decoded and pretty-printed, that message body looks like this\n\ndata=```\n<code class=\"block\" id=\"output\">{\n    \"items\":[\n       {\n           \"title\":\"DJ's+Weblog\",\n           \"description\":\"Reserving+the+right+to+be+wrong\",\n           \"link\":\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/\"\n       }\n    ]\n}```\n\nThis is what your app gets to process.\n\nBruno said that the format was chosen to be compatible with the Yahoo! Pipes Web Service Module, and it sure is \u2014 look at this example from the [Web Service Module](http:\/\/pipes.yahoo.com\/pipes\/docs?doc=operators#WebService) documentation:\n\ndata={ \"items\":[ { \"title\": \"First Title\", \"link\": \"http:\/\/example.com\/first\", \"description\": \"First Description\" }, { \"title\": \"Last Title\", \"link\": \"http:\/\/example.com\/last\", \"description\": \"Last Description\" } ] }\n\nAnd what about those three output fields on the right hand side of the REST connector? Well, if your app returns a response with JSON in the body \u2014 this time not as a name\/value pair, but as pure JSON \u2014 like this:\n\n{ \"items\":[ \u00a0 { \u00a0\"title\": \"The response!\", \u00a0\"description\": \"Long text description of the response\", \u00a0\"link\": \"http:\/\/example.org\/banana\/\" \u00a0} \u00a0 ] }\n\nthen the workflow can continue and you can connect those values in the corresponding **title**, **description** and **link** output fields as input to further connectors.\n\nHappy tarpiping!\n\n\n","html":"<p>Tarpipe implemented a REST connector a short while ago.

I like to see things visually, and I&#8217;m guessing others do too, so I decided to write a little handler to receive a sample request from the REST connector to dump it for inspection.<\/p>\n<p>As Bruno showed in the announcement, this is what the REST connector looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-612\" title=\"Tarpipe REST connector\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/05\/tarpiperestconnector.png\" alt=\"Tarpipe REST connector\" width=\"176\" height=\"268\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It will take whatever values it receives in the <strong>title<\/strong>, <strong>description<\/strong> and <strong>link<\/strong> input fields on the left hand side of the connector, and construct a piece of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.json.org\/\">JSON<\/a> which it then sends in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html401\/interact\/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1\">application\/x-www-form-urlencoded<\/a> format as a data=&lt;JSON&gt; name\/value pair in the message body of an HTTP POST request to the resource specified in the <strong>serviceUrl<\/strong> field.<\/p>\n<p>So if we pass the values &#8220;<em>DJ&#8217;s Weblog<\/em>&#8221; into the title, &#8220;<em>Reserving the right to be wrong<\/em>&#8221; into the description, &#8220;<em>http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/<\/em>&#8221; into the link fields, and pass &#8220;<em>http:\/\/example.org\/bucket\/<\/em>&#8221; into the serviceUrl field, the following HTTP request is made on the http:\/\/example.org\/bucket\/ resource like this:<\/p>\n<pre>POST \/bucket\/ HTTP\/1.1\nContent-Length: 218\nContent-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded\nHost: example.org\nAccept: *\/*\n\ndata=%7B%22items%22%3A%5B%7B%22title%22%3A%22DJ%27s+Weblog%22%2C%22description\n     %22%3A%22Reserving+the+right+to+be+wrong%5Cn%22%2C%22link%22%3A%22http%3A\n     %5C%2F%5C%2Fwww.pipetree.com%5C%2Fqmacro%5C%2Fblog%5C%2F%22%7D%5D%7D<\/pre>\n<p>(whitespace added by me for readability).<\/p>\n<p>When decoded and pretty-printed, that message body looks like this<\/p>\n<pre>data=<code id=\"output\" class=\"block\">{\n    \"items\":[\n       {\n           \"title\":\"DJ's+Weblog\",\n           \"description\":\"Reserving+the+right+to+be+wrong\",\n           \"link\":\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/\"\n       }\n    ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This is what your app gets to process.<\/p>\n<p>Bruno said that the format was chosen to be compatible with the Yahoo! Pipes Web Service Module, and it sure is &#8212; look at this example from the <a href=\"http:\/\/pipes.yahoo.com\/pipes\/docs?doc=operators#WebService\">Web Service Module<\/a> documentation:<\/p>\n<pre>data={\n    \"items\":[\n       {\n           \"title\": \"First Title\",\n           \"link\": \"http:\/\/example.com\/first\",\n           \"description\": \"First Description\"\n       },\n       {\n           \"title\": \"Last Title\",\n           \"link\": \"http:\/\/example.com\/last\",\n           \"description\": \"Last Description\"\n       }\n    ]\n}<\/pre>\n<p>And what about those three output fields on the right hand side of the REST connector? Well, if your app returns a response with JSON in the body &#8212; this time not as a name\/value pair, but as pure JSON &#8212; like this:<\/p>\n<pre>{\n  \"items\":[\n\u00a0    {\n        \u00a0\"title\": \"The response!\",\n        \u00a0\"description\": \"Long text description of the response\",\n        \u00a0\"link\": \"http:\/\/example.org\/banana\/\"\n    \u00a0}\n\u00a0 ]\n}<\/pre>\n<p>then the workflow can continue and you can connect those values in the corresponding <strong>title<\/strong>, <strong>description<\/strong> and <strong>link<\/strong> output fields as input to further connectors.<\/p>\n<p>Happy tarpiping!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Thu, 21 May 2009 18:53:31 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 21 May 2009 18:53:31 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 21 May 2009 18:53:31 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":638,"title":"Information vs Behaviour","slug":"information-vs-behaviour","markdown":"\nI read a couple of chapters of two different books recently:\n\n- Ch.5 of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u201c[Beautiful Architecture](http:\/\/oreilly.com\/catalog\/9780596517984\/)\u201c: *Resource-Oriented Architectures: Being \u2018In The Web\u2019* by Brian Sletten\n- Ch.1 of Manning\u2019s \u201c[SOA Patterns](http:\/\/www.manning.com\/rotem\/)\u201c: *Solving SOA Pains With Patterns* by Arnon Rotem-Gal-Oz, Eric Bruno, and Udi Dahan (from a free online Early Access Program)\n\n<div>In these chapters, there were points made that stood out for me and underlined the fact that the two approaches of Resource Oriented Architecture (ROA) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) are mostly diametrically opposed, along the axes of **information** and **behaviour**.<\/div><div>I\u2019ve been saying for a while, and indeed [recently](http:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/2332492780), that the data in an enterprise is a key asset of any corporation, and should be treated as such.

Recently there\u2019s been a spate of interest around interaction with devices, applications and systems \u2026 via a chat-style interface. This is nothing new, of course. Bots have existed on the IRC networks for a long time. The venerable [Purl](http:\/\/www.foo.be\/docs\/tpj\/issues\/vol3_2\/tpj0302-0002.html), an [infobot](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Infobot), was a particular favourite of mine. When instant messaging (IM) came along, we had a new chat interface \u2013 which took the form of one-on-one or conference (\u2018group\u2019) chat. With [Jabber](http:\/\/www.jabber.org\/) (XMPP), \u2018Chatbot\u2019 was a favourite in the various conference rooms. Back in late 2002, I even wrote about Chatbot in a 2-part series \u201cThe Command Line of the Future\u201d (\u201c[Is Jabber\u2019s Chatbot the Command Line of the Future?](http:\/\/openp2p.com\/pub\/a\/p2p\/2002\/01\/11\/jabber_bots.html)\u201d and The \u201c[Command Line of the Future Part 2: Expanding Chatbot\u2019s Repertoire](http:\/\/openp2p.com\/pub\/a\/p2p\/2002\/02\/08\/chatbot_two.html)\u201c):\n\n> Consider for a moment what this command line of the future might look like. More and more people are online. More and more people are permanently connected, whether it be through DSL, cable, or 802.11 technology. And more and more of these people are communicating. Talking. Having conversations. In addition to email and Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, the (relatively) new kid on the block, Instant messaging (IM), is playing a huge part in facilitating these conversations. And in the same way that it\u2019s common for us to have a command prompt or three sitting on our graphical desktop, it\u2019s also becoming common to have chat windows more or less permanently open on the desktop too.\n\n> But when thinking of IM, why stop at conversations with people?

And what\u2019s more, because of the similarities between a classic command-line prompt and that of a chat window, where you\u2019re talking with a bot \u2014 both scenarios are text-based \u2014 interaction with a bot is scriptable.\n\nForward to the present.\n\nJust the other day, [@davemee](http:\/\/twitter.com\/davemee) and [@technicalfault](http:\/\/twitter.com\/technicalfault) alerted me to [@manairport](http:\/\/twitter.com\/manairport), Manchester Airport\u2019s online persona on Twitter, obviously yet another chat-style interface.

You follow it, it will follow you back, and you\u2019re away.\n\n> me: d manairport be7217\n> \n> manairport: Received request for information: be7217 manairport: Status of 17:40 flight BE7217 to Dusseldorf departing T3: Scheduled 17:40\n\nNice and [useful](http:\/\/www.dopplr.com\/trip\/qmacro\/825806)!\n\nAnd then just this morning, I read a weblog post on [SDN](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com) entitled \u201c[SAP Enterprise Service and Google Wave](https:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/weblogs?blog=\/pub\/wlg\/15521)\u201c. In it, the author talks about connecting Google Wave (you guessed it, yet another chat-style interface, amongst other things) with SAP, in particular enterprise \u2018services\u2019. In the short demo, order information from an SAP system is retrieved in a conversational way. The concept is great. The obvious issue with what\u2019s shown in the demo (and I know it\u2019s only a proof of concept) is that the bot responds with a data structure dump of information. What we\u2019re looking for is something more, well, consumable by humans. Smaller, more distinct and addressable pieces of information that can be returned and be useful.\n\nBut what was more telling, at least to me, were the difficulties he described in connecting to the complex Enterprise Service backend in SAP:\n\n> \u201c\u2026 find the webservice \u2026 create a proxy \u2026 I did have some problems with calling the ES \u2026 On Appengine there are some limitations on what you can call of Java classes \u2026 From an architectural point I\u2019m not real proved of the solution\u2026\u201d\n\nHmm. Why does architecture have to be complex? Using Enterprise Services, using SOA, is more complex than it needs to be. There\u2019s a reason why the web works. There\u2019s a reason why Google designed App Engine\u2019s backend infrastructure (including [asynchronous task queues](http:\/\/googleappengine.blogspot.com\/2009\/06\/new-task-queue-api-on-google-app-engine.html)) in a simple HTTP-orientated way. There\u2019s a reason why the Wave robot protocol is based on simple HTTP mechanisms. There\u2019s a reason why mechanisms like [PubSubHubBub](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pubsubhubbub\/) and [Webhooks](http:\/\/webhooks.pbworks.com\/) are based on HTTP as an application protocol. Because simple works, and it works well.\n\nLet\u2019s come back to the \u201csmaller, more distinct and addressable\u201d issue. If we let ourselves be guided by a Resource Orientated Architecture (ROA) approach, rather than a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) approach, we end up with simpler application protocols, flexible, reliable and transparent integration, and pieces of information that are addressable \u2014 and [usable](https:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/weblogs?blog=\/pub\/wlg\/584) \u2014 first class citizens on the web. This is Twitter\u2019s [killer feature](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2009\/05\/twitters-success\/).\n\nEnterprises suffer enough with complexity paralysis. We should endeavour to embrace the design of HTTP as an application protocol (which is what I\u2019m doing with [Coffeeshop](http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/qmacro\/coffeeshop)), rather than fight against it.\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is a bit of a hand-wavy post, but I wanted to get my thoughts down.

And what&#8217;s more, because of the similarities between a classic command-line prompt and that of a chat window, where you&#8217;re talking with a bot &#8212; both scenarios are text-based &#8212; interaction with a bot is scriptable.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Forward to the present.<\/p>\n<p>Just the other day, <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/davemee\">@davemee<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/technicalfault\">@technicalfault<\/a> alerted me to <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/manairport\">@manairport<\/a>, Manchester Airport&#8217;s online persona on Twitter, obviously yet another chat-style interface. You can interact with it via direct messages (DMs). You follow it, it will follow you back, and you&#8217;re away.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>me: d manairport be7217<\/pre>\n<pre>manairport: Received request for information: be7217\nmanairport: Status of 17:40 flight BE7217 to Dusseldorf\n            departing T3: Scheduled 17:40<\/pre>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Nice and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dopplr.com\/trip\/qmacro\/825806\">useful<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>And then just this morning, I read a weblog post on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\">SDN<\/a> entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/weblogs?blog=\/pub\/wlg\/15521\">SAP Enterprise Service and Google Wave<\/a>&#8220;. In it, the author talks about connecting Google Wave (you guessed it, yet another chat-style interface, amongst other things) with SAP, in particular enterprise &#8216;services&#8217;. In the short demo, order information from an SAP system is retrieved in a conversational way. The concept is great. The obvious issue with what&#8217;s shown in the demo (and I know it&#8217;s only a proof of concept) is that the bot responds with a data structure dump of information. What we&#8217;re looking for is something more, well, consumable by humans. Smaller, more distinct and addressable pieces of information that can be returned and be useful.<\/p>\n<p>But what was more telling, at least to me, were the difficulties he described in connecting to the complex Enterprise Service backend in SAP:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230; find the webservice &#8230; create a proxy &#8230; I did have some problems with calling the ES &#8230; On Appengine there are some limitations on what you can call of Java classes &#8230; From an architectural point I&#8217;m not real proved of the solution&#8230;&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Hmm. Why does architecture have to be complex? Using Enterprise Services, using SOA, is more complex than it needs to be. There&#8217;s a reason why the web works. There&#8217;s a reason why Google designed App Engine&#8217;s backend infrastructure (including <a href=\"http:\/\/googleappengine.blogspot.com\/2009\/06\/new-task-queue-api-on-google-app-engine.html\">asynchronous task queues<\/a>) in a simple HTTP-orientated way. There&#8217;s a reason why the Wave robot protocol is based on simple HTTP mechanisms. There&#8217;s a reason why mechanisms like <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/pubsubhubbub\/\">PubSubHubBub<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/webhooks.pbworks.com\/\">Webhooks<\/a> are based on HTTP as an application protocol. Because simple works, and it works well.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s come back to the &#8220;smaller, more distinct and addressable&#8221; issue. If we let ourselves be guided by a Resource Orientated Architecture (ROA) approach, rather than a Service Orientated Architecture (SOA) approach, we end up with simpler application protocols, flexible, reliable and transparent integration, and pieces of information that are addressable &#8212; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/weblogs?blog=\/pub\/wlg\/584\">usable<\/a> &#8212; first class citizens on the web. This is Twitter&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2009\/05\/twitters-success\/\">killer feature<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Enterprises suffer enough with complexity paralysis. We should endeavour to embrace the design of HTTP as an application protocol (which is what I&#8217;m doing with <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.github.com\/qmacro\/coffeeshop\">Coffeeshop<\/a>), rather than fight against it.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 12:10:12 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 12:10:12 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 21 Aug 2009 12:10:12 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":745,"title":"Dealing with \"#blogtheft\" from SAP's Developer Network","slug":"dealing-with-blogtheft-from-saps-developer-network","markdown":"\nRecently it has [come to people\u2019s attention](http:\/\/search.twitter.com\/search?q=%23blogtheft) that there is a website www.sap-abap4.com out there with a lot of very interesting content \u2026 which seems to have been *completely* \u201clifted\u201d from the [SAP Developer Network](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com) (SDN) and reproduced verbatim, except that in each case the original author name has been removed!\n\nLots of discussion is taking place how best to deal with this.

A Gmail contextual gadget enhances email messages by providing information or functionality that is relevant to the context of that email \u2026 right inside the email itself. Context is exposed by content extractors in the form of \u2018clues\u2019 in Gmail (akin to Dashboard\u2019s \u2018[cluepackets](http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/xml\/library\/x-desktop\/index.html#h2)\u2018) and matched content is provided to the gadget at runtime.\n\nExtractors, optional filters, and scope declarations (used by the installer of a gadget to decide whether to install or not based upon privacy and security requirements) are defined in a manifest, along with references to the gadgets themselves, via gadget spec files, that are to be triggered.\n\n![additnow](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/additnow.png \"Add it now\")\n\nWhat makes these Gmail contextual gadgets even more attractive is the Google Apps Marketplace, where developers can make gadgets available, and consumers can use the \u201c[Add it now](https:\/\/www.google.com\/support\/a\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&answer=172482)\u201d button to start using them in their own domains.\n\nDeveloping Gmail contextual gadgets is relatively straightforward, but there are a few things that might cause you to stumble, such as documentation (we\u2019re early adopters!), cacheing issues and not being completely aware of what match information is provided.\n\nDespite the advent of Wave and Buzz, it\u2019s obvious that Google sees, rightly in my opinion, a tremendous amount of value in the venerable email application, and I thought I\u2019d take the opportunity to document my first attempt at enhancing the contextual experience with a Twitter-flavoured Gmail contextual \u201cHello World\u201d gadget.\n\n**Twitter User Info**\n\n\u2018Twitter User Info\u2019 is a Gmail contextual gadget that provides basic info about Twitter users whose Twitter handles appear in the email Subject line. In this example, the profile image and basic Twitter user info is shown for Joseph, whose Twitter handle [@jcla1](http:\/\/twitter.com\/@jcla1) appears in the Subject of the email from Michelle:\n\n![Twitter User Info for @jcla1](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/twitteruserinfoannotated.png \"Twitter User Info for @jcla1\")\n\nThe contextual gadget appears directly below the email body, and starts with the title and description \u201cTwitter \u2013 User Info\u201d (defined in the gadget spec) and contains HTML showing the Twitter info.\n\n**Components and hosting**\n\nWhat are the components that make up this gadget? First of all, we need the manifest and the gadget spec itself. To support the dynamic creation of contextual content in the email, we will be using [jQuery](http:\/\/jquery.com\/), not only because it\u2019s a fantastically useful and powerful library for manipulating web page content, but also because of Google\u2019s intention to use [Caja ](http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-caja\/)to provide a layer of protection for the user of Javascript-based apps. The jQuery library is listed as one of the development frameworks that will be compatible with Caja. There\u2019s also a tiny bit of CSS.\n\nBeyond that, we will of course be making a call to one of the [Twitter API](http:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/) endpoints, and calling upon one of my favourite HTTP tools [PostBin](http:\/\/postbin.org), to dump Google gadget libary method return values for inspection.\n\nWhile the manifest is uploaded to Google when you make your gadget available in the Marketplace, your gadget spec needs to be accessible online (so the gadget container can pull it in at the appropriate moment). There are many options for hosting content online, but for this experiment I decided to create a new App Engine application \u2018[qmacro-contextual](http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com)\u2018 and host the gadget and CSS as static files there (I\u2019m also storing the manifest there too). This might appear as overkill, but as I progress further into contextual gadget development, I will most definitely want to do some of the heavy app lifting outside of the actual gadget spec, and for this, App Engine is ideal.\n\nHere\u2019s part of the app.yaml file showing the handler declarations for the static manifest, gadget and CSS resources:\n\napplication: qmacro-contextual version: 1 runtime: python api_version: 1 handlers: - url: \/manifests static_dir: manifests expiration: 1m - url: \/gadgets static_dir: gadgets expiration: 1m - url: \/css static_dir: css - url: .* script: main.py<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal; font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span>\n\nNote that I\u2019ve specified an expiration period of 1 minute for the manifest and gadget spec directories. This is for development only, so that I can be sure that at least App Engine will serve up the resources with a very short shelf life, so that I can tweak the definitions and code and have them reloaded by the gadget container.\n\nIncidentally, there\u2019s also a URL query string parameter you can specify that causes gadget cacheing to be turned off \u2013 just append \u201c?nogadgetcache=1\u2033 to the Gmail URL and this should do the trick.\n\n**The Manifest**\n\nI followed the Developer\u2019s Guide to construct the manifest, which you can see here in full:\n\n[http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/manifests\/twitter-user-info.manifest.xml](http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/manifests\/twitter-user-info.manifest.xml)\n\nThe interesting parts of the manifest which relate to Gmail contextual gadgets are the Extractor, Gadget and Scope declarations.\n\nThe Extractor declaration looks like this:\n\n<!-- EXTRACTOR --> <Extension id=\"SubjectExtractor\" type=\"contextExtractor\"> <Name>Twitter IDs in Subject<\/Name> <Url>google.com:SubjectExtractor<\/Url> <Param name=\"subject\" value=\".*@[a-z]+.*\"\/> <Triggers ref=\"TwitterUserInfoGadget\"\/> <Scope ref=\"emailSubject\"\/> <Container name=\"mail\"\/> <\/Extension>\n\nEach extractor (there can be more than one for any given manifest) is defined with an id and name and references a particular Extractor ID which does the work of pulling the info out of the email. Here we\u2019re referencing [google.com:SubjectExtractor](http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/gmail\/gadgets\/contextual\/#extractor), which is an extractor provided by Google for pulling out the Subject line. Google will be opening up opportunities for developers to build their own extractors if the pre-defined ones don\u2019t provide what we need.\n\nThe google.com:SubjectExtractor is defined as returning one output field, @subject, which is made available to the gadget to do with as it wishes \u2013 more on that later. It also has one scope defined, tag:google.com,2010:auth\/contextual\/extractor\/SUBJECT, which must be linked with a scope definition in a later section of the manifest.\n\nWe can see the reference to the @subject output field in the <Param\/> tag. This is a filter definition, which says here that we only want the extractor to trigger the gadget if the email subject matches the given regular expression \u2013 i.e. if it contains a Twitter handle. Clearly, we want to avoid triggering gadgets when there\u2019s nothing for the gadget to do; not only to avoid unnecessary almost-empty gadget displays, but also for performance reasons; without a filter, this extractor would fire for every email you looked at. The filter is optional, but Google recommends that even if you want to match on every occurrence, you put an explicit catch-all regular expression \u201c.*\u201d to make that clear.\n\nThe reference to \u201cTwitterUserInfoGadget\u201d points to the next declaration, that of the gadget itself:\n\n<!-- GADGET --> <Extension id=\"TwitterUserInfoGadget\" type=\"gadget\"> <Name>Twitter User Info contextual gadget<\/Name> <Url>http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml<\/Url> <Container name=\"mail\"\/> <\/Extension>\n\nThe id of the gadget, \u201cTwitterUserInfoGadget\u201d is what is referred to in the <Triggers\/> tag of the previous Extractor declaration. The gadget is a resource, located at\n\n[http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml](http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml)\n\nand this is what will be requested by the Gmail contextual gadget container to pull in the gadget spec. Here\u2019s part of an App Engine log record showing the gadget spec being fetched:\n\n![Google Feedfetcher pulls gadget spec](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/feedfetcherpullsgadget1.png \"Google Feedfetcher pulls gadget spec\")\n\nThe name declared in this Gadget declaration (\u201cTwitter User Info contextual gadget\u201d), along with the name in the Extractor declaration (\u201cTwitter IDs in Subject\u201d) and the general name and description from elsewhere in the manifest, are text items that appear to the Google Apps domain administrator when selecting the gadget for installation, like this:![App Overview](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/appoverview.png \"App Overview\")\n\nFinally, we have the Scope declaration, which was indicated in the Extractor declaration earlier. This is \u201cemailSubject\u201d, and contains the scope URI defined for the extractor being used. There may be more than one scope for a given extractor; if this is the case, they must be each defined separately and explicitly.\n\n<!-- SCOPE --> <Scope id=\"emailSubject\"> <Url>tag:google.com,2010:auth\/contextual\/extractor\/SUBJECT<\/Url> <Reason>This application looks at the subject of each email looking for Twitter handles<\/Reason> <\/Scope>\n\nThis information appears during gadget installation, where the administrator can review what the gadget will access, and decide whether or not to proceed:\n\n![Grant Data Access](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/grantdataaccess.png \"Grant Data Access\")\n\nOnce you\u2019ve defined your manifest, you must upload it as part of the overall Listing Information required to offer a gadget or an app on Google Apps Marketplace. You have to sign up to become a vendor with Google in order to do this. It\u2019s free, as is the listing of unpublished test gadgets and apps, so you can experiment all you need to.\n\n![Manifest](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/manifest.png \"Manifest\")\n\n**The Gadget Spec \u2013 Declarations**\n\nNow we\u2019ve dealt with the manifest, it\u2019s time to turn our attention to the gadget spec. Remember that the gadget is triggered when we get a Subject line that contains one or more Twitter handles. If you\u2019ve developed a gadget before, for iGoogle, for example, this should be familiar to you. First we have the ModulePrefs section where we declare basic gadget information and the features that we require. There\u2019s a feature specific to Gmail contextual gadgets that we must declare here. Then we have the gadget code itself, in a CDATA section.\n\nHere\u2019s what the ModulePrefs section looks like:\n\n <ModulePrefs title=\"Twitter\" description=\"User Info\" height=\"50\" author=\"DJ Adams\" author_email=\"dj.adams@pobox.com\" author_location=\"Manchester\"> <Require feature=\"dynamic-height\"\/> <Require feature=\"google.contentmatch\"> <Param name=\"extractors\"> google.com:SubjectExtractor <\/Param> <\/Require> <\/ModulePrefs>\n\nThe title and description in the module prefs shows up (\u201dTwitter \u2013 User Info\u201d) when the gadget is displayed at the bottom of the email. We define a height for the gadget which can be auto-adjusted later with the dynamic-height feature declared in this section too. A feature that\u2019s specific to Gmail contextual gadgets, and that must be declared for all such gadgets, is google.contentmatch. In declaring this feature, you must list the Extractor id (or ids) that will be triggering this gadget.\n\nThe google.contentmatch feature gives us the facility we need to avail ourselves of the, ahem, content that was matched in this context. As you will see, we use the getContentMatches() method to do this.\n\n**The Gadget Spec \u2013 Code**\n\nWith the ModulePrefs declarations out of the way, we get to the Javascript that breathes life into our gadget. The Javascript is defined in the <Content\/> tag. The view type \u201ccard\u201d is the only one supported by Gmail contextual gadgets right now.\n\n<script type='text\/javascript' src='http:\/\/ajax.googleapis.com\/ajax\/libs\/jquery\/1.4.2\/jquery.min.js'><\/script> <script type=\"text\/javascript\"> \/\/ Expect subject as first element keyed by 'subject' matches = google.contentmatch.getContentMatches(); jQuery.post('http:\/\/qmacro-postbin.appspot.com\/1jd620g', 'matches:' + JSON.stringify(matches)); var subject = matches[0]['subject']; \/\/ Only do something if we actually have a subject to work with if (subject) { \/\/ Pick out the twitter @handles and process them var handles = subject.match(\/@[a-z0-9_]+\/g); if (handles) { $('head').append('<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/css\/twitter-user-info.css\" \/>'); for (var i = 0; i < handles.length; i++) { var user_resource = 'http:\/\/api.twitter.com\/users\/show\/' + handles[i] + '.json?callback=?'; $.getJSON(user_resource, function(data) { jQuery.post('http:\/\/qmacro-postbin.appspot.com\/1jd620g', 'userinfo:' + JSON.stringify(data)); var loc = \"\"; if (data.location) { loc = ' (' + data.location + ')'; } var tw_info = '<table border=\"0\">' + '<tr>' + '<td>' + '<a href=\"' + data.url + '\">' + '<img src=\"' + data.profile_image_url + '\" \/>' + '<\/a>' + '<\/td>' + '<td class=\"userinfo\">' + '<a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/' + data.screen_name + '\">@' + data.screen_name + '<\/a>' + '<br \/>' + data.name + loc + '<br \/>' + data.description + '<\/td>' + '<\/tr><\/table>'; jQuery(tw_info).appendTo('body'); }); } gadgets.window.adjustHeight(100); } } <\/script><span style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: small;\"><span><\/span><\/span>\n\nFirst, we pull in the jQuery library with a <script\/> tag, and then we\u2019re off with our gadget code.\n\nWe use the google.contentmatch.getContentMatches() method to pull in the matches supplied to us by the Extractor. One of my favourite phrases is \u201c[let the dog see the rabbit](http:\/\/en.wikiquote.org\/wiki\/Only_Fools_and_Horses#Chain_Gang_.5B6.3.5D)\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s have a look at the data, in this case. What does the getContentMatches() actually return? What does it look like? This is where the rather useful PostBin comes in to play. When we get the response from the call to getContentMatches(), encode it into a JSON string form with JSON.stringify() and bung the whole lot to a Postbin too see. Easy! Of course, this is only appropriate for development and debugging \u2013 I\u2019d remove it for a production gadget. By the way, I\u2019m running my own instance of Postbin \u2013 you can [run you own instance](http:\/\/github.com\/progrium\/postbin) too.\n\n![Matches in Postbin](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/matchesinpostbin1.png \"Matches in Postbin\")So from looking at what we get,\u00a0we can see that what we\u2019re after is the value of the \u2019subject\u2019 key in the first element of the matches array.\n\nBy definition, we\u2019re only instantiated because there was a Twitter handle in the Subject. There could be more than one, of course. After collecting them into a handles array, we\u2019re ready to process each one. First, though \u2013 we pull in the CSS resource to the current document. The resource is served as a static file from the App Engine app:\n\n[http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/css\/twitter-user-info.css](http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/css\/twitter-user-info.css)\n\nFor each of the Twitter handles, we want to display some basic info, as shown in the screenshot earlier. To retrieve this, we make a simple call to the Twitter API. Specifically,\n\n[http:\/\/api.twitter.com\/users\/show\/[Twitter-handle].json?callback=](http:\/\/apiwiki.twitter.com\/Twitter-REST-API-Method:-users%C2%A0show)?\n\nwill give us a nice chunk of JSON with the information we want, like this:\n\n{ \"description\":\"Developer and Linux Expert\", \"screen_name\":\"Jcla1\", \"url\":\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/josephadams\", \"name\":\"Joseph Adams\", \"profile_image_url\":\"http:\/\/a1.twimg.com\/profile_images\/106288960\/JosephWithLomaxCar_normal.jpg\", \"location\":\"Krefeld,Germany\", ... }\n\nI\u2019d originally started with the[ jTwitter](http:\/\/plugins.jquery.com\/project\/jtwitter) jQuery plugin but found that it didn\u2019t quite do what I wanted, and in any case using the Twitter API from jQuery is straightforward anyway. But thank you [uzbekjon](http:\/\/plugins.jquery.com\/user\/9986) for getting me started.\n\nYou can see from the code that I\u2019m making more use of Postbin, by gratuitously dumping the results of the Twitter API call in there too. I like to see what I\u2019m dealing with. [Data::Dumper](http:\/\/search.cpan.org\/perldoc?Data::Dumper) is my alltime favourite Perl module, if you hadn\u2019t guessed.\n\nOnce we have the info from Twitter, it\u2019s just a simple matter of constructing some HTML, making use of the CSS via the \u2018userinfo\u2019 class, and appending that to the email.\u00a0Job done!\n\nI\u2019ve pushed my fledgeling [qmacro-contextual App Engine project to Github](http:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/qmacro-contextual), so you can take a look and create your own \u201cHello World\u201d Gmail contextual gadget.\n\nShare and enjoy!\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/gmail\/gadgets\/contextual\/\">Gmail contextual gadgets<\/a> were announced by Google a few months back and were <a href=\"http:\/\/googleenterprise.blogspot.com\/2010\/05\/putting-email-in-context-with-gmail.html\">made available to developers in May this year<\/a>, just before making a <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/events\/io\/2010\/sessions\/deep-dive-gmail-contextual-gadgets.html\">strong appearance at Google IO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding upon the concept of an earlier contextual project called\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2003\/07\/dashboard-a-compelling-articulation-for-realtime-contextual-information-2\/\">Dashboard<\/a>, Gmail contextual gadgets give a clear message that email, as a universal information carrier and workflow pipeline, is not only here to stay, but is being given a new lease of life as it plays a foundational role in Google&#8217;s enterprise scale application platform strategy. A Gmail contextual gadget enhances email messages by providing information or functionality that is relevant to the context of that email &#8230; right inside the email itself. Context is exposed by content extractors in the form of &#8216;clues&#8217; in Gmail (akin to Dashboard&#8217;s &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/xml\/library\/x-desktop\/index.html#h2\">cluepackets<\/a>&#8216;) and matched content is provided to the gadget at runtime.<\/p>\n<p>Extractors, optional filters, and scope declarations (used by the installer of a gadget to decide whether to install or not based upon privacy and security requirements) are defined in a manifest, along with references to the gadgets themselves, via gadget spec files, that are to be triggered.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-804 alignright\" title=\"Add it now\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/additnow.png\" alt=\"additnow\" width=\"228\" height=\"84\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What makes these Gmail contextual gadgets even more attractive is the Google Apps Marketplace, where developers can make gadgets available, and consumers can use the &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/support\/a\/bin\/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=172482\">Add it now<\/a>&#8221; button to start using them in their own domains.<\/p>\n<p>Developing Gmail contextual gadgets is relatively straightforward, but there are a few things that might cause you to stumble, such as documentation (we&#8217;re early adopters!), cacheing issues and not being completely aware of what match information is provided.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the advent of Wave and Buzz, it&#8217;s obvious that Google sees, rightly in my opinion, a tremendous amount of value in the venerable email application, and I thought I&#8217;d take the opportunity to document my first attempt at enhancing the contextual experience with a Twitter-flavoured Gmail contextual &#8220;Hello World&#8221; gadget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Twitter User Info<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Twitter User Info&#8217; is a Gmail contextual gadget that provides basic info about Twitter users whose Twitter handles appear in the email Subject line. In this example, the profile image and basic Twitter user info is shown for Joseph, whose Twitter handle <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/@jcla1\">@jcla1<\/a> appears in the Subject of the email from Michelle:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-812\" title=\"Twitter User Info for @jcla1\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/twitteruserinfoannotated.png\" alt=\"Twitter User Info for @jcla1\" width=\"605\" height=\"429\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The contextual gadget appears directly below the email body, and starts with the title and description &#8220;Twitter &#8211; User Info&#8221; (defined in the gadget spec) and contains HTML showing the Twitter info.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Components and hosting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What are the components that make up this gadget? First of all, we need the manifest and the gadget spec itself. To support the dynamic creation of contextual content in the email, we will be using <a href=\"http:\/\/jquery.com\/\">jQuery<\/a>, not only because it&#8217;s a fantastically useful and powerful library for manipulating web page content, but also because of Google&#8217;s intention to use <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-caja\/\">Caja <\/a>to provide a layer of protection for the user of Javascript-based apps. The jQuery library is listed as one of the development frameworks that will be compatible with Caja. There&#8217;s also a tiny bit of CSS.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, we will of course be making a call to one of the <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/\">Twitter API<\/a> endpoints, and calling upon one of my favourite HTTP tools <a href=\"http:\/\/postbin.org\">PostBin<\/a>, to dump Google gadget libary method return values for inspection.<\/p>\n<p>While the manifest is uploaded to Google when you make your gadget available in the Marketplace, your gadget spec needs to be accessible online (so the gadget container can pull it in at the appropriate moment). There are many options for hosting content online, but for this experiment I decided to create a new App Engine application &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\">qmacro-contextual<\/a>&#8216; and host the gadget and CSS as static files there (I&#8217;m also storing the manifest there too). This might appear as overkill, but as I progress further into contextual gadget development, I will most definitely want to do some of the heavy app lifting outside of the actual gadget spec, and for this, App Engine is ideal.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s part of the app.yaml file showing the handler declarations for the static manifest, gadget and CSS resources:<\/p>\n<pre>application: qmacro-contextual\nversion: 1\nruntime: python\napi_version: 1\n\nhandlers:\n- url: \/manifests\n  static_dir: manifests\n  expiration: 1m\n\n- url: \/gadgets\n  static_dir: gadgets\n  expiration: 1m\n\n- url: \/css\n  static_dir: css\n\n- url: .*\n  script: main.py<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal; font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/pre>\n<p>Note that I&#8217;ve specified an expiration period of 1 minute for the manifest and gadget spec directories. This is for development only, so that I can be sure that at least App Engine will serve up the resources with a very short shelf life, so that I can tweak the definitions and code and have them reloaded by the gadget container.<\/p>\n<p>Incidentally, there&#8217;s also a URL query string parameter you can specify that causes gadget cacheing to be turned off &#8211; just append &#8220;?nogadgetcache=1&#8243; to the Gmail URL and this should do the trick.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Manifest<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I followed the Developer&#8217;s Guide to construct the manifest, which you can see here in full:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/manifests\/twitter-user-info.manifest.xml\">http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/manifests\/twitter-user-info.manifest.xml<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The interesting parts of the manifest which relate to Gmail contextual gadgets are the Extractor, Gadget and Scope declarations.<\/p>\n<p>The Extractor declaration looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;!-- EXTRACTOR --&gt;\n&lt;Extension id=\"SubjectExtractor\" type=\"contextExtractor\"&gt;\n  &lt;Name&gt;Twitter IDs in Subject&lt;\/Name&gt;\n  &lt;Url&gt;google.com:SubjectExtractor&lt;\/Url&gt;\n  &lt;Param name=\"subject\" value=\".*@[a-z]+.*\"\/&gt;\n  &lt;Triggers ref=\"TwitterUserInfoGadget\"\/&gt;\n  &lt;Scope ref=\"emailSubject\"\/&gt;\n  &lt;Container name=\"mail\"\/&gt;\n&lt;\/Extension&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>Each extractor (there can be more than one for any given manifest) is defined with an id and name and references a particular Extractor ID which does the work of pulling the info out of the email. Here we&#8217;re referencing <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/gmail\/gadgets\/contextual\/#extractor\">google.com:SubjectExtractor<\/a>, which is an extractor provided by Google for pulling out the Subject line. Google will be opening up opportunities for developers to build their own extractors if the pre-defined ones don&#8217;t provide what we need.<\/p>\n<p>The google.com:SubjectExtractor is defined as returning one output field, @subject, which is made available to the gadget to do with as it wishes &#8211; more on that later. It also has one scope defined, tag:google.com,2010:auth\/contextual\/extractor\/SUBJECT, which must be linked with a scope definition in a later section of the manifest.<\/p>\n<p>We can see the reference to the @subject output field in the &lt;Param\/&gt; tag. This is a filter definition, which says here that we only want the extractor to trigger the gadget if the email subject matches the given regular expression &#8211; i.e. if it contains a Twitter handle. Clearly, we want to avoid triggering gadgets when there&#8217;s nothing for the gadget to do; not only to avoid unnecessary almost-empty gadget displays, but also for performance reasons; without a filter, this extractor would fire for every email you looked at. The filter is optional, but Google recommends that even if you want to match on every occurrence, you put an explicit catch-all regular expression &#8220;.*&#8221; to make that clear.<\/p>\n<p>The reference to &#8220;TwitterUserInfoGadget&#8221; points to the next declaration, that of the gadget itself:<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;!-- GADGET --&gt;\n&lt;Extension id=\"TwitterUserInfoGadget\" type=\"gadget\"&gt;\n  &lt;Name&gt;Twitter User Info contextual gadget&lt;\/Name&gt;\n  &lt;Url&gt;http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml&lt;\/Url&gt;\n  &lt;Container name=\"mail\"\/&gt;\n&lt;\/Extension&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>The id of the gadget, &#8220;TwitterUserInfoGadget&#8221; is what is referred to in the &lt;Triggers\/&gt; tag of the previous Extractor declaration. The gadget is a resource, located at<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml\">http:\/\/qmacro-contextual.appspot.com\/gadgets\/twitter-user-info.gadget.xml<\/a><\/p>\n<p>and this is what will be requested by the Gmail contextual gadget container to pull in the gadget spec. Here&#8217;s part of an App Engine log record showing the gadget spec being fetched:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-827\" title=\"Google Feedfetcher pulls gadget spec\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/feedfetcherpullsgadget1.png\" alt=\"Google Feedfetcher pulls gadget spec\" width=\"644\" height=\"115\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The name declared in this Gadget declaration (&#8220;Twitter User Info contextual gadget&#8221;), along with the name in the Extractor declaration (&#8220;Twitter IDs in Subject&#8221;) and the general name and description from elsewhere in the manifest, are text items that appear to the Google Apps domain administrator when selecting the gadget for installation, like this:<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-831\" title=\"App Overview\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/appoverview.png\" alt=\"App Overview\" width=\"293\" height=\"239\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, we have the Scope declaration, which was indicated in the Extractor declaration earlier. This is &#8220;emailSubject&#8221;, and contains the scope URI defined for the extractor being used. There may be more than one scope for a given extractor; if this is the case, they must be each defined separately and explicitly.<\/p>\n<pre>&lt;!-- SCOPE --&gt;\n&lt;Scope id=\"emailSubject\"&gt;\n  &lt;Url&gt;tag:google.com,2010:auth\/contextual\/extractor\/SUBJECT&lt;\/Url&gt;\n  &lt;Reason&gt;This application looks at the subject of each email\n     looking for Twitter handles&lt;\/Reason&gt;\n&lt;\/Scope&gt;<\/pre>\n<p>This information appears during gadget installation, where the administrator can review what the gadget will access, and decide whether or not to proceed:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-832\" title=\"Grant Data Access\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/grantdataaccess.png\" alt=\"Grant Data Access\" width=\"635\" height=\"312\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve defined your manifest, you must upload it as part of the overall Listing Information required to offer a gadget or an app on Google Apps Marketplace. You have to sign up to become a vendor with Google in order to do this. It&#8217;s free, as is the listing of unpublished test gadgets and apps, so you can experiment all you need to.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-836\" title=\"Manifest\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/manifest.png\" alt=\"Manifest\" width=\"444\" height=\"289\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>The Gadget Spec &#8211; Declarations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve dealt with the manifest, it&#8217;s time to turn our attention to the gadget spec. Remember that the gadget is triggered when we get a Subject line that contains one or more Twitter handles. If you&#8217;ve developed a gadget before, for iGoogle, for example, this should be familiar to you. First we have the ModulePrefs section where we declare basic gadget information and the features that we require. There&#8217;s a feature specific to Gmail contextual gadgets that we must declare here.

Walking around talking to people thinking, discussing, designing and building innovative prototypes covering a huge range of topics, I [came across](http:\/\/twitpic.com\/2wnjre) Phil Kisloff ([@kisloff](http:\/\/twitter.com\/kisloff)) and Fred Verheul ([@fredverheul](http:\/\/twitter.com\/fredverheul)) who were building something using Composite Designer (part of the [Composite Application Framework](http:\/\/www.sap.com\/platform\/netweaver\/cafindex.epx)). \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look much like SE38!\u201d I thought.\n\nSure, SAP have been developing non-core software, services and processes for years now. But it hasn\u2019t been until today that the realisation has truly hit home for me. The only team I\u2019ve found that\u2019s building anything in ABAP here is \u2026 ours. Ok, [Gregor Wolf](http:\/\/twitter.com\/wolf_gregor) told me about some very interesting work on [Webhooks](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/tag\/webhooks\/) last night which involved some ABAP coding, but that was probably more out of necessity rather than anything else. BPM is on everyone\u2019s lips. Moreover, to speak of SAP\u2019s Java server offering is already pass\u00e9 and almost uninteresting.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s River.\n\nRiver is a project that has been collaboratively built by the SAP Labs teams in Israel and Palo Alto. I talked to Lior Schejter who told me more about it. It\u2019s a platform-as-a-service offering that\u2019s remotely related to Google\u2019s App Engine (although with more UI) and that allows the development, customisation, hosting and running of \u201csmall\u201d applications. It\u2019s hosted on Amazon EC2 and uses Tomcat to serve. Applications are built in the flow-logic style of BPM, and consist of user interfaces (what I saw was Flash-based) with business logic controlling the processes in the back end. There\u2019s a UI builder, and the business logic can be built and modified either diagramatically or with Javascript, which runs on the server.\n\nEven though River is arguably in beta right now, what I saw was very impressive. It\u2019s also fair to say that there are a number of milestones that the team are working towards. Online editing and development is essentially a <textarea\/> element right now. There\u2019s no source code repository integration or version control. Yes, I know what you\u2019re saying, and I agree: River could learn and take from the fascinating and fabulous [Bespin](https:\/\/bespin.mozillalabs.com\/) (now \u2018[SkyWriter](https:\/\/mozillalabs.com\/skywriter\/)\u2018) project. In fact, there\u2019s a loose connection already: at last year\u2019s SAP TechEd in Vienna I got Bespin connected to, and checking in and out from, [SAP\u2019s Code Exchange](http:\/\/wiki.sdn.sap.com\/wiki\/display\/CodeExchange\/Code+Exchange+Platform) platform. Furthermore, offering the ability to debug Javascript than runs on the server is not a simple task (even [Google Apps Script](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/) doesn\u2019t have that yet, and developing and debugging for apps destined for Google\u2019s App Engine is done locally using the [SDK](http:\/\/code.google.com\/appengine\/downloads.html)). Lior told me of a very interesting and so far successful approach to solving this problem: run and debug the Javascript locally and use a proxy for the River-specific API calls.\n\nThere is of course plenty more to say about River, as you can imagine. The project is very interesting and they\u2019re attempting to address hard problems and built a very current offering. But what struck me the most about River is the technologies they\u2019re using, and the audiences and customers that SAP are addressing. These are expanding all the time. Lior even related to me that it had been difficult for his team to find a person who knew ABAP, to help with some of the (minor!) experimental BAPI backend integration!\n\nA far cry from the days of old.

More on that another time.\n\nAt the end of the meetup, I suggested an example of something that would be really easy to put together using Google Apps Script, and very useful: a mechanism to convert incoming emails automatically into tasks.\n\nYou can of course convert an email into a task *manually* using the Gmail UI like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1031\" style=\"width: 610px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/AddToTasks1.jpg \"AddToTasks\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/AddToTasks1.jpg)Manually adding a task from an email\n\n<\/div>But rather than have to open Gmail, find the task email, select it and then choose More Actions -> Add to Tasks, I wanted a hands-off facility where I could, say from my work email, fire off a quick one-liner task that would be added to my list of tasks automatically, silently and without fuss.\n\nWith effective use of Gmail\u2019s filter facility, labels and a little bit of Apps Script using the Gmail Services, I was able to create a mechanism in the time it took to enjoy my morning coffee.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Building the Automated Email-to-Task Mechanism**\n\nHere\u2019s how I saw it working:\n\n1. create a couple of new labels: \u2018newtask\u2019 and \u2018newtaskdone\u2019\n2. specify a Gmail filter to assign the label \u2018newtask\u2019 to emails coming from my work email address, and with the recipient being \u2018qmacro+task@gmail.com\u2019\n3. write a script to process messages in threads assigned to the \u2018newtask\u2019 label by parsing the subject out, creating a new task, and inserting that task into my tasklist\n4. schedule this script to run hourly\n\nThen I could\u00a0fire off an email to qmacro+task@gmail.com from work, with the task 1-liner in the Subject, and have that task automatically show up on my task list. Ideal!\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Filter**\n\nOnce you have the labels, create the filter. This is what the action part of my filter looks like:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1034\" style=\"width: 610px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/CreateAFilter.jpg \"CreateAFilter\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/CreateAFilter.jpg)Specifying the filter actions\n\n<\/div>I\u2019m specifying that the email be assigned to the label \u2018newtask\u2019, that it should marked as read immediately, and not appear in the inbox. That way, I don\u2019t get distracted by the noise of task emails in my inbox. If you\u2019re wondering about the \u2018newtaskdone\u2019 label, we\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The Script Context**\n\nNow we\u2019re all set up \u2013 we can write the script to process the relevant emails, i.e. all those assigned the label \u2018newtask\u2019.\n\nStart by creating a new Spreadsheet \u00a0\u2013 the script can live attached to that. Add the text \u2018Processed tasks\u2019 to cell A1. We\u2019ll use this to show how many tasks the script has processed. Use the menu option Tools -> Script editor to get to the Google Apps Script editor.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1040\" style=\"width: 538px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/MailManagementSheet.jpg \"MailManagementSheet\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/MailManagementSheet.jpg)Mail Management sheet\n\n<\/div>\u00a0\n\nYou can call your project \u2018Mail Management\u2019, or whatever you want:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1039\" style=\"width: 371px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/MailManagementScript.jpg \"MailManagementScript\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/MailManagementScript.jpg)Mail Management script\n\n<\/div>\u00a0\n\n**The Script Code**\n\nOk, let\u2019s run through the script step by step.\n\nWe start with a few constants: the name of the tasklist into which we want our new tasks inserted, and the two labels.\n\nTASKLIST = \"DJ's list\"; LABEL_PENDING = \"newtask\"; LABEL_DONE = \"newtaskdone\";\n\nNext we have a helper function getTasklistId_ which uses the Tasks Services from the new [Google APIs Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/googleapisservices.html) in Apps Script. You\u2019ll need to explicitly state you want to use the Google APIs Services from the File menu, which will lead you to a popup where you can switch on the Tasks API and use the [Google API Console](http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/console-help\/) to create a project and generate an API key which you\u2019ll need. All of this is described in ample detail in a great article \u201c[Integrating with Google APIs \u2013 Creating a simple reading list](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/articles\/google_apis_reading_list.html)\u201c.\n\nThis getTasklistId_ function returns a tasklist ID for a given tasklist name \u2014 in this case we\u2019ll be asking for the ID of the tasklist called \u201cDJ\u2019s list\u201d. It\u2019s early days for the Tasks API and there are a few oddities: In theory we should be able to use the simple API call :\n\nTasks.Tasklists.get(tasklistName)\n\nbut this is currently resulting in an error. So instead we\u2019ll grab a list of all the tasklists, and iterate over them looking for our tasklist name. I\u2019ve suffixed the name of this function, and others in this script, with an underscore; this prevents them from showing up in the dropdown list of runnable functions at the top of the editor.\n\nfunction getTasklistId_(tasklistName) { var tasklistsList = Tasks.Tasklists.list(); var taskLists = tasklistsList.getItems(); for (tl in taskLists) { var title = taskLists[tl].getTitle(); if (title == tasklistName) { return taskLists[tl].getId(); } } }\n\nNext we have another helper function addTask_ which will create a new task, given a string, and add that new task to a tasklist, given a tasklist ID. Note the separation of concerns \u2013 a task is created independently of a tasklist, then inserted into that tasklist.\n\nfunction addTask_(title, tasklistId) { var newTask = Tasks.newTask().setTitle(title); Tasks.Tasks.insert(newTask, getTasklistId_(tasklistId)); }\n\nWe then come to the definition of processPending_, which does the bulk of the mechanism\u2019s work. This function gets a handle on each of the two labels we mentioned earlier (labels in the [Gmail Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_gmail.html) are one of three main classes, along with threads and messages). The idea is that we will process \u2018pending\u2019 emails assigned to the \u2018newtask\u2019 label, and then switch the thread to the \u2018newtaskdone\u2019 label so it won\u2019t get processed a second time. With a call to the getThreads() method of the pending label object, we get a list of threads. We\u2019re assuming that there\u2019s only one email in each thread (task emails are separate and different each time), and so we grab the subject from the first message in each thread to use as the 1-liner task title, and use the addTask_ helper function to insert a new task into the tasklist.\n\nOnce this is done we remove the \u2018newtask\u2019 label and assign the \u2018newtaskdone\u2019 label to the thread.\n\nFinally, we increment the \u2018Processed tasks\u2019 counter in the sheet, for a quick indication of how many email-to-task conversions have taken place.\n\nfunction processPending_(sheet) { var label_pending = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(LABEL_PENDING); var label_done = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(LABEL_DONE); \/\/ The threads currently assigned to the 'pending' label var threads = label_pending.getThreads(); \/\/ Process each one in turn, assuming there's only a single \/\/ message in each thread for (var t in threads) { var thread = threads[t]; \/\/ Grab the task data var taskTitle = thread.getFirstMessageSubject(); \/\/ Insert the task addTask_(taskTitle, TASKLIST); \/\/ Set to 'done' by exchanging labels thread.removeLabel(label_pending); thread.addLabel(label_done); } \/\/ Increment the processed tasks count var processedRange = sheet.getRange(\"B1\"); processedRange.setValue(processedRange.getValue() + threads.length) }\n\nThis last function, main_taskconverter, is more a matter of personal style rather than necessity \u2013 it\u2019s the main function that we will start the whole mechanism off with, and the function that we\u2019ll specify in the trigger so this script will run on a regular basis.

You&#8217;ll need to explicitly state you want to use the Google APIs Services from the File menu, which will lead you to a popup where you can switch on the Tasks API and use the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/apis\/console-help\/\">Google API Console<\/a> to create a project and generate an API key which you&#8217;ll need. All of this is described in ample detail in a great article &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/articles\/google_apis_reading_list.html\">Integrating with Google APIs &#8211; Creating a simple reading list<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>This getTasklistId_ function returns a tasklist ID for a given tasklist name &#8212; in this case we&#8217;ll be asking for the ID of the tasklist called &#8220;DJ&#8217;s list&#8221;. It&#8217;s early days for the Tasks API and there are a few oddities: In theory we should be able to use the simple API call :<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\"  class=\"javascript\">Tasks.Tasklists.get(tasklistName)<\/pre>\n<p>but this is currently resulting in an error. So instead we&#8217;ll grab a list of all the tasklists, and iterate over them looking for our tasklist name. I&#8217;ve suffixed the name of this function, and others in this script, with an underscore; this prevents them from showing up in the dropdown list of runnable functions at the top of the editor.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\"  class=\"javascript\">function getTasklistId_(tasklistName) {\n  var tasklistsList = Tasks.Tasklists.list();\n  var taskLists = tasklistsList.getItems();\n  for (tl in taskLists) {\n    var title = taskLists[tl].getTitle();\n    if (title == tasklistName) {\n      return taskLists[tl].getId();\n    }\n  }\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Next we have another helper function addTask_ which will create a new task, given a string, and add that new task to a tasklist, given a tasklist ID. Note the separation of concerns &#8211; a task is created independently of a tasklist, then inserted into that tasklist.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\"  class=\"javascript\">function addTask_(title, tasklistId) {\n  var newTask = Tasks.newTask().setTitle(title);\n  Tasks.Tasks.insert(newTask, getTasklistId_(tasklistId));\n}<\/pre>\n<p>We then come to the definition of processPending_, which does the bulk of the mechanism&#8217;s work. This function gets a handle on each of the two labels we mentioned earlier (labels in the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_gmail.html\">Gmail Services<\/a> are one of three main classes, along with threads and messages). The idea is that we will process &#8216;pending&#8217; emails assigned to the &#8216;newtask&#8217; label, and then switch the thread to the &#8216;newtaskdone&#8217; label so it won&#8217;t get processed a second time. With a call to the getThreads() method of the pending label object, we get a list of threads. We&#8217;re assuming that there&#8217;s only one email in each thread (task emails are separate and different each time), and so we grab the subject from the first message in each thread to use as the 1-liner task title, and use the addTask_ helper function to insert a new task into the tasklist.<\/p>\n<p>Once this is done we remove the &#8216;newtask&#8217; label and assign the &#8216;newtaskdone&#8217; label to the thread.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we increment the &#8216;Processed tasks&#8217; counter in the sheet, for a quick indication of how many email-to-task conversions have taken place.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\"  class=\"javascript\">function processPending_(sheet) {\n\n  var label_pending = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(LABEL_PENDING);\n  var label_done = GmailApp.getUserLabelByName(LABEL_DONE);\n\n  \/\/ The threads currently assigned to the 'pending' label\n  var threads = label_pending.getThreads();\n\n  \/\/ Process each one in turn, assuming there's only a single\n  \/\/ message in each thread\n  for (var t in threads) {\n    var thread = threads[t];\n\n    \/\/ Grab the task data\n    var taskTitle = thread.getFirstMessageSubject();\n\n    \/\/ Insert the task\n    addTask_(taskTitle, TASKLIST);\n\n    \/\/ Set to 'done' by exchanging labels\n    thread.removeLabel(label_pending);\n    thread.addLabel(label_done);\n  }\n\n  \/\/ Increment the processed tasks count\n  var processedRange = sheet.getRange(\"B1\");\n  processedRange.setValue(processedRange.getValue() + threads.length)\n}<\/pre>\n<p>This last function, main_taskconverter, is more a matter of personal style rather than necessity &#8211; it&#8217;s the main function that we will start the whole mechanism off with, and the function that we&#8217;ll specify in the trigger so this script will run on a regular basis. We get a reference to the active spreadsheet, set the first sheet to be the active one (it usually is anyway) and call the processPending_ function.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\"  class=\"javascript\">function main_taskconverter() {\n\n  \/\/ Get the active spreadsheet and make sure the first\n  \/\/ sheet is the active one\n  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();\n  var sh = ss.setActiveSheet(ss.getSheets()[0]);\n\n  \/\/ Process the pending task emails\n  processPending_(sh);\n}<\/pre>\n<p>And that&#8217;s all there is to it!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scheduling Regular Execution<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We want this mechanism to run regularly in the background, so that it converts all incoming task emails to tasks without our intervention.

Check out a previous blog post \u201c[Automated Email-to-Task Mechanism with Google Apps Script](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/automated-email-to-task-mechanism-with-google-apps-script\/)\u201d for more background on this Tasks API and the Google article\u00a0\u201c[Integrating with Google APIs \u2013 Creating a simple reading list](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/articles\/google_apis_reading_list.html)\u201c for a step-by-step account of enabling the API itself \u00a0(called Tasks Services in Google Apps Script).\n\n**Working with Tasklists and Tasks**\n\nSo, what do we need to do with the Tasks Services? As you can gather from watching the screencast in the Part 1, we need to retrieve a list of existing tasklists, we might need to create a new tasklist, and we need to be able to add tasks to a specific tasklist. We also need to build a Ui component to present the list of the user\u2019s tasklists, so a tasklist can be chosen, plus an option to create a new tasklist.\n\n**Retrieving the Tasklists**\n\nLet\u2019s start with retrieving a list of tasklists. \u00a0While this is pretty simple, we\u2019ll encapsulate it in a function as we\u2019ll be calling it a couple of times within this example.\n\nfunction getTasklists_() { var tasklistsList = Tasks.Tasklists.list(); return tasklistsList.getItems(); }\n\nWe use the Tasklists member of the Tasks class which gives us a TasklistsCollection class. We call call the list() method to retrieve a [Tasklists](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_tasks_v1_schema_tasklists.html) object \u2013 which represents a list of all the authenticated user\u2019s tasklists. Calling getItems() on this object gives us an array of Tasklist objects \u2013 which is the list of tasklists that we need.\n\n**Building the Ui**\n\nWe\u2019ll need the list of tasklists to show in the Ui component. So let\u2019s look at building that Ui component next. Building user interfaces in Google Apps Script can appear somewhat daunting at first glance, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 it\u2019s actually very straightforward. You have the choice between building the Ui in code (by using [Ui Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_ui.html) calls) or using a visual editor much like you might in other IDEs. This latter approach was [announced and described in detail on the Google Apps Developer blog](http:\/\/googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com\/2011\/06\/building-ui-in-apps-script-just-got.html),\u00a0following this year\u2019s Google I\/O.\n\nWe\u2019ll build our Ui in code. If you need an intro to this, have a look at the Google Apps Script \u201c[Building a User Interface](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/guide_user_interfaces.html)\u201d documentation.\n\nWe want to be able to display to the user a list of their existing tasklists so they can choose one, and also give them a chance to enter the name of a new tasklist instead. So we need a dropdown list (otherwise known as a listbox), a textbox, some text labels, and a button. This is what the end result should look like:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1101\" style=\"width: 269px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/tasklists.png \"Task Lists Ui\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/tasklists.png)Task Lists Ui\n\n<\/div>It\u2019s showing the Ui title (\u201cTask Lists\u201d), some labels, a dropdown list with the two existing tasklists that the authenticated user has already, an empty textbox (behind the dropdown) where a new tasklist name can be entered and a button to which we can attach an event handler.\n\nLayout is achieved using Panels and Grids, both containers for elements. Here, we\u2019ll use a [VerticalPanel](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_verticalpanel.html), where the elements are arranged vertically, and a [Grid](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_grid.html), where we can arrange elements in a 2-dimensional way.\n\nSchematically, this is what we\u2019re going to do:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1104\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/TaskListsUiLayoutSchematic1-300x209.png \"Task Lists Ui Layout Schematic\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/TaskListsUiLayoutSchematic1.png)Task Lists Ui Layout Schematic\n\n<\/div>So, let\u2019s look at the code that builds this Ui. We start by getting a handle on the active spreadsheet (doc), and creating a new Ui application (app), giving it a title. At the end of this function we\u2019ll be passing the Ui application to the active spreadsheet to show.\n\nfunction taskListUi() { var doc = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var app = UiApp.createApplication(); app.setTitle('Task Lists');\n\nNext, we create a vertical panel (panel), and a listbox (lb), both of which exist independently. We set a name for the listbox (\u2018existingList\u2019) so we can refer to it later in the callback context. After using the getTasklists_() function described earlier, we fill the listbox with those tasklist names (or \u2018titles\u2019) retrieved.\n\n \/\/ We'll have a grid and a button in this \/\/ vertical panel var panel = app.createVerticalPanel(); \/\/ Use a listbox to display a choice of existing tasklists var lb = app.createListBox(false); lb.setName(\"existingList\"); var tasklists = getTasklists_(); for (var tl in tasklists) { lb.addItem(tasklists[tl].getTitle()); }\n\nOnce we\u2019ve got the listbox populated, it\u2019s time to create the grid (a 2 x 2 layout) and fill the cells with labels, the listbox, and a textbox. We give a name to the textbox (\u2018newList\u2019) so we can refer to it later in the callback context, in the same way as for the listbox.\n\n \/\/ Use the grid to layout the listbox, a textbox for a new list, \/\/ and some corresponding labels var grid = app.createGrid(2, 2); grid.setWidget(0,0, app.createLabel(\"Existing:\")); grid.setWidget(0,1, lb); grid.setWidget(1,0, app.createLabel(\"Or new:\")); grid.setWidget(1,1, app.createTextBox().setName(\"newList\"));\n\nFinally we have the button element. Simple enough, but we also need to add a click handler to it in the form of a [serverClickHandler](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_serverclickhandler.html). This handler exists as a function in this same script: handleChooseButton_() which is defined after this. The important thing to notice here is that we create an independent serverClickHandler, give it some element context (in this case the grid element we created earlier) so that the element values are available in the context of the handling function, and then assign that handler as a click handler to the button element.\n\n \/\/ The only button; handler will be linked to this button click event \/\/ Remember to add the grid contents to the callback context var button = app.createButton(\"Choose\"); var chooseHandler = app.createServerClickHandler(\"handleChooseButton_\"); chooseHandler.addCallbackElement(grid); button.addClickHandler(chooseHandler);\n\nOnce we\u2019ve created the button element and sorted out how the click event will be handled, it\u2019s time to put the Ui together. We add the elements one by one to the vertical panel: a label, the 2 x 2 grid, then the button. Then we add the actual panel to the app, hand it over to the active spreadsheet to be displayed, and let go!\n\n \/\/ Put it all together and show it panel.add(app.createLabel(\"Select existing or create new list\")); panel.add(grid); panel.add(button); app.add(panel); doc.show(app); }\n\n**Handling the Button Click**\n\nThe handling of the click is performed by handleChooseButton_(), as determined by the call to [createServerClickHandler()](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_uiinstance.html#createServerClickHandler) earlier. Let\u2019s examine handleChooseButton_() step by step.\n\nWe start by assuming that the user has chosen an existing tasklist \u2013 we get the value from the listbox via its name within the parameter attribute of the event object passed to the function, i.e. e.parameter.existingList. Then again, if we\u2019ve got a value in the textbox representing the option to create a new tasklist, we create a new tasklist using the Tasks.newTaskList() method of the Tasks Services, and give that new tasklist the title that was specified in the textbox.\n\nNote that setTitle() was called directly in a \u2018chain\u2019 from newTaskList(), and the result assigned to the newTaskList variable. This is possible due to the way the Tasks API has been designed, with most TaskList methods returning the TaskList object itself; this is known as the \u2018bean\u2019 object.\n\nfunction handleChooseButton_(e) { \/\/ Assume an existing list was chosen var selectedList = e.parameter.existingList; \/\/ But check for a new list being specified; if it as, create \/\/ a new task list if(e.parameter.newList != '') { selectedList = e.parameter.newList; var newTaskList = Tasks.newTaskList().setTitle(selectedList); Tasks.Tasklists.insert(newTaskList); }\n\nNow we\u2019ve determined the chosen tasklist (either an existing one or a newly created one) we grab the complete list with getTasklists_() and have a look through them to find the corresponding tasklist id, which we\u2019ll need when we want to insert new tasks into that tasklist.\n\n \/\/ Grab the list of tasklists, because we'll need the id var taskLists = getTasklists_(); var taskListId = -1; for(tl in taskLists){ if(taskLists[tl].getTitle() === selectedList) { taskListId = taskLists[tl].getId(); break; } }\n\nOk, we\u2019ve determined and retrieved the id for the chosen tasklist, so now it\u2019s time to save that info. We\u2019ll do that by writing both the tasklist name and id into a cell; the tasklist name into the cell itself, and the id into the cell\u2019s comment. This is a common idiom and is quite useful \u2013 you can store related information in a single cell, and don\u2019t use up too much cell \u2018real estate\u2019. The cell we\u2019re going to use is stored as a constant: READINGLISTCELL; in my spreadsheet that\u2019s cell D1.\n\n \/\/ Record the list name and id var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); var cell = sh.getRange(READINGLISTCELL); cell.setValue(selectedList); cell.setComment(taskListId);\n\nOnce we\u2019ve stored the information, it\u2019s time for the handler to make sure the Ui is closed, and to acknowledge to the user that a selected list has been recognised. We do this by closing the active Ui application, and using the Spreadsheet\u2019s generic \u2018[toast](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_spreadsheet.html#toast)\u2018 mechanism to pop up a message.\n\n \/\/ Close the Ui popup and display the name of the chosen list var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication(); app.close(); SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().toast(selectedList, \"Selected List\", 3); return app; }\n\nHurray \u2013 that\u2019s the Ui component and the handler all taken care of!\n\nTune in next time when in Part 3 we look at retrieving information from the Google+ activity stream via the Google+ API, using nothing more than our trusty Google Apps Script HTTP client, [UrlFetchApp](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_urlfetchapp.html).\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is Part 2 in a series about an example app that I put together to demonstrate and describe the use of various Google Apps Script features.

This is possible due to the way the Tasks API has been designed, with most TaskList methods returning the TaskList object itself; this is known as the &#8216;bean&#8217; object.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">function handleChooseButton_(e) {\n\n  \/\/ Assume an existing list was chosen\n  var selectedList = e.parameter.existingList;\n\n  \/\/ But check for a new list being specified; if it as, create\n  \/\/ a new task list\n  if(e.parameter.newList != '') {\n    selectedList = e.parameter.newList;\n    var newTaskList = Tasks.newTaskList().setTitle(selectedList);\n    Tasks.Tasklists.insert(newTaskList);\n  }<\/pre>\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve determined the chosen tasklist (either an existing one or a newly created one) we grab the complete list with getTasklists_() and have a look through them to find the corresponding tasklist id, which we&#8217;ll need when we want to insert new tasks into that tasklist.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Grab the list of tasklists, because we'll need the id\n  var taskLists = getTasklists_();\n  var taskListId = -1;\n  for(tl in taskLists){\n    if(taskLists[tl].getTitle() === selectedList) {\n      taskListId = taskLists[tl].getId();\n      break;\n    }\n  }<\/pre>\n<p>Ok, we&#8217;ve determined and retrieved the id for the chosen tasklist, so now it&#8217;s time to save that info. We&#8217;ll do that by writing both the tasklist name and id into a cell; the tasklist name into the cell itself, and the id into the cell&#8217;s comment. This is a common idiom and is quite useful &#8211; you can store related information in a single cell, and don&#8217;t use up too much cell &#8216;real estate&#8217;. The cell we&#8217;re going to use is stored as a constant: READINGLISTCELL; in my spreadsheet that&#8217;s cell D1.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Record the list name and id\n  var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\n  var cell = sh.getRange(READINGLISTCELL);\n  cell.setValue(selectedList);\n  cell.setComment(taskListId);<\/pre>\n<p>Once we&#8217;ve stored the information, it&#8217;s time for the handler to make sure the Ui is closed, and to acknowledge to the user that a selected list has been recognised. We do this by closing the active Ui application, and using the Spreadsheet&#8217;s generic &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_spreadsheet.html#toast\">toast<\/a>&#8216; mechanism to pop up a message.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Close the Ui popup and display the name of the chosen list\n  var app = UiApp.getActiveApplication();\n  app.close();\n  SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().toast(selectedList, \"Selected List\", 3);\n  return app;\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Hurray &#8211; that&#8217;s the Ui component and the handler all taken care of!<\/p>\n<p>Tune in next time when in Part 3 we look at retrieving information from the Google+ activity stream via the Google+ API, using nothing more than our trusty Google Apps Script HTTP client, <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_urlfetchapp.html\">UrlFetchApp<\/a>.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 22:16:24 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 22:16:24 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 10 Oct 2011 22:16:24 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1132,"title":"Reading List Mark 2 - Part 3","slug":"reading-list-mark-2-part-3","markdown":"\nThis is Part 3 in a series about an example app that I put together to demonstrate and describe the use of various Google Apps Script features.

This part is \u201c**Using the UrlFetch Services to interact with the Google+ API (after all, it\u2019s REST-based!) and grab info on articles pointed to by users in their activity stream**\u201c.\n\n**Parts Overview**\n\n1.

Following the [simplest thing that could possibly work](http:\/\/c2.com\/xp\/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html) philosophy, all we need to do to fetch a resource and grab the payload is to use the UrlFetchApp class, specifically the fetch() method. It returns an [HTTPResponse](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_httpresponse.html) object, which has everything you need: content, headers and response code.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of getting the signature from the server that serves this site:\n\nvar response = UrlFetchApp.fetch('http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/'); Logger.log(response.getHeaders()['Server']);\n\n--> Apache\/2.2.14 (Ubuntu)\n\nThe Google+ API largely follows a RESTful design, which means that we can use the UrlFetch Services to interact with it.\n\n**The Google+ API**\n\nThe [Google+ API](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/+\/api\/) is relatively new, and at the moment, read-only. This is fine for what we want to use it for in this example. There are two aspects of the API that are relevant for us:\n\n- The REST-based nature means that we see the Google+ objects such as People, Activities and Comments as resources that we retrieve with HTTP\n- To use the API we need either an OAuth 2.0 token or an API key\n\nThe UrlFetch Services provides us with a facility in the form of the OAuthConfig class for configuring and managing OAuth in a client context. But we\u2019ll go for the simpler approach and use an API key, which we can obtain by using the Google API Console \u2013 see the previous instalment of this series for more details about this: [Using the Tasks API to retrieve and insert tasklists, and the Ui Services to build the tasklist chooser component](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-2\/).\n\nThe idea for this example app is to capture a list of URLs that a person on Google+ has posted, and perhaps commented on. We can get this info from the [Activities](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/+\/api\/latest\/activities) part of the API.\n\nTo get the activity stream for a given person, we need to retrieve the following resource:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/plus\/v1\/people\/{userId}\/activities\/{collection}\n\nThe {userId} is the Google+ ID of the person, and {collection} in this case is \u201cpublic\u201d, the only collection available right now. In addition we need to specify our API key on a \u2018key\u2019 parameter in the query string. The default representation is JSON. This is what we get back as a result (heavily elided for brevity):\n\n{ \"kind\": \"plus#activityFeed\", \"title\": \"Plus Public Activity Feed for Martin Hawksey\", \"id\": \"tag:google.com,2010:\/plus\/people\/1146628[...]\/activities\/public\", \"items\": [ { \"kind\": \"plus#activity\", \"title\": \"Latest post from me. Elevator pitch: [...]\", \"id\": \"z12cxlppixzwjbqzi04cdnvg1wbyflbz3r00k\", \"url\": \"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/1146628[...]\", \"verb\": \"post\", \"object\": { \"objectType\": \"note\", \"content\": \"Latest post from me. Elevator pitch: Service [...]\", \"originalContent\": \"\", \"url\": \"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/1146628[...]\", \"attachments\": [ { \"objectType\": \"article\", \"displayName\": \"SpreadEmbed: Turning a Google Spreadsheet [...]\", \"url\": \"http:\/\/mashe.hawksey.info\/2011\/10\/spreadembed\/\" }, { \"objectType\": \"photo\", \"image\": { \"url\": \"http:\/\/images0-focus-opensocial.google[...]\", \"type\": \"image\/jpeg\" }, \"fullImage\": { \"url\": \"http:\/\/mcdn.hawksey.info\/wp-content\/uploads\/[...]\", \"type\": \"image\/jpeg\", \"height\": 204, \"width\": 350 } [...]\n\nEven after heavy eliding for this blog post, that\u2019s still an awful lot of JSON, but we\u2019re only actually interested in the URLs that the person links to. We can spot these in the \u201cplus#activity\u201d items array, as attachments with objectType \u201carticle\u201d \u2013 they have url and displayName attributes:\n\n{ \"items\": [ { \"kind\": \"plus#activity\", \"object\": { \"attachments\": [ { \"objectType\": \"article\", \"displayName\": \"SpreadEmbed: Turning a Google Spreadsheet [...]\", \"url\": \"http:\/\/mashe.hawksey.info\/2011\/10\/spreadembed\/\" }, [...]\n\n**Partial Responses**\n\nAnd it just so happens that in the interests of efficiency, Google offers [partial responses](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/+\/api\/#partial-response), in the form of a fields parameter. So we can add this parameter to the query string, with an XPath-style value like this:\n\nfields=items\/object\/attachments(url,displayName)\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; white-space: normal;\">So the resulting JSON representation is a lot lighter, like this:<\/span>\n\n{ \"items\": [ { \"object\": { \"attachments\": [ { \"displayName\": \"SpreadEmbed: Turning a Google Spreadsheet[...]\", \"url\": \"http:\/\/mashe.hawksey.info\/2011\/10\/spreadembed\/\" } ] } }, ] }\n\nMuch better!\n\n**Retrieving the Activity Data**\n\nSo now it\u2019s time to have a look at the code that will retrieve the activity info and insert the URLs into the spreadsheet. We\u2019ll do this in a single function retrieveActivityUrls_(), which will\n\n- grab any existing URLs listed in the sheet, so we can work out whether each new one retrieved with the API call is already there or not\n- Determine the ID of the person on Google+ we want to follow\n- Build the name of the Google+ activity resource (the Google+ API URL), fetch it and parse the content\n- Look through the parsed content and note any new URLs that the person has linked to on Google+\n- Insert those new URLs into the sheet\n\nLet\u2019s go!\n\nFirst, some constants.\n\nAPIKEY = 'AIza[...]drBs'; \/\/ (get your own!) ACTIVITYLISTURL = 'https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/plus\/v1\/people\/{userId}\/activities\/{collection}'; USERIDCELL = 'B1'; USERID = '106413090159067280619'; \/\/ Fallback: Mahemoff!\n\nNow for the function. We get a handle on the active sheet, note the last row (which denotes where the list of URLs currently ends), and gets those URLs. We\u2019re assuming that the list starts at row 2, i.e. there\u2019s a header line in row 1. The resulting urlList array is two dimensional, although as we\u2019ve specified we only want 1 column width of values, the data will look something like this:\n\n[[http:\/\/cloud9ide.com], [http:\/\/jsconf.eu], [...]]\n\nWe create an object to hold the existing (\u2018old\u2019) URLs, and the eventual \u2018new\u2019 URLs about to be retrieved. We\u2019re using an object \u2018old\u2019 for the existing URLs so we can easily check whether a new one is in the list or not. We just need to use an array for the \u2018new\u2019 URLs.\n\nfunction retrieveActivityUrls_() { \/\/ Grab existing list of URLs var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); var lastRow = sh.getLastRow(); var urlList = sh.getRange(2, 1, lastRow - 1 || 1) .getValues(); var list = {'old': {}, 'new': []}; for (var i in urlList){ list['old'][urlList[i]] = 1; }\n\nWe\u2019re going to retrieve the activity for a Google+ person, and the person is identified by an ID either in a cell in the sheet identified by the range in constant USERIDCELL, (see the screencast in [Part 1](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-1\/)) or a default specified in constant USERID.\n\n \/\/ Use the userid in the sheet, fallback to a favourite var userid = sh.getRange(USERIDCELL).getValue() || USERID;\n\nNow we have enough information to build the Google+ API resource URL, so we call a helper function buildActivityListUrl_() passing it the user ID, the collection (\u2018public\u2019), and our API key. (We\u2019ll look at buildActivityListUrl_() shortly.) We use the UrlFetchApp fetch() method to grab the resource, calling getContentText() to obtain the JSON content. And with a JSON parser available in the [Utilities Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_utilities.html), we quickly have all we need to retrieve those URLs posted in the activity list in the \u2018activities\u2019 object.\n\n \/\/ Build Google+ API resource and retrieve it; parse JSON content var actListUrl = buildActivityListUrl_(userid, 'public', APIKEY); var jsonString = UrlFetchApp.fetch(actListUrl).getContentText(); var activities = Utilities.jsonParse(jsonString);\n\nFrom examining the JSON representation of the activities earlier in this post, we know we\u2019ll be expecting items, and within each item an object member, and within that object member a number of attachments. We\u2019re only interested in those attachments of type \u2018article\u2019, and if we find one, we want the url and the displayName.\n\nIf we\u2019ve got an article attachment, we then need to determine whether it\u2019s a new URL or one we have already. That\u2019s where the list object comes in. Unless we can find the URL in the \u2018old\u2019 object, it\u2019s a new one so we need to add it to the \u2018new\u2019 list.\n\n \/\/ We're looking for the item object attachments, where the \/\/ attachment's objectType is 'article'. We want the url and displayName for (var i in activities.items) { var attachments = activities.items[i].object.attachments; for (var a in attachments) { var attachment = attachments[a]; \/\/ We've got a URL and title; store it as new if it doesn't \/\/ already exist. Store it as list of lists, ready for \/\/ a setValues([][]) insert if (attachment.objectType == 'article') { if (! (attachment.url in list['old'])) { list['new'].push([attachment.url, attachment.displayName]); } } } }\n\nAt this stage, we\u2019re ready to add any new URLs to the list in the sheet. Note that when we pushed onto the \u2018new\u2019 list, we pushed an array of the url and displayName. This is the ideal two dimensional array ([[a, b], [c, d], [...]) to specify as the value in the\u00a0[setValues()](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_range.html#setValues) call on a two dimensional cell Range. And useful if we want to follow the sage advice in \u201c[Common Programming Tasks](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/guide_common_tasks.html)\u201d on using batch operations where possible: we can add all the new URL info to the sheet in a single getRange() and setValues() call pair:\n\n \/\/ Blammo! if (list['new'].length) { sh.getRange(lastRow + 1, 1, list['new'].length, 2).setValues(list['new']); } }\n\nNow that\u2019s the retrieveActivityUrls_() \u00a0function out of the way, let\u2019s just have a look at the helper function buildActivityListUrl_() that we called earlier. It takes three parameters: the ID of the person on Google+, the collection we want to retrieve (\u2018public\u2019 in this case), and the API key. It uses a URL template in the ACTIVITYLISTURL constant and replaces the placeholders. It also adds the API key, and the XPath fields statement.\n\nfunction buildActivityListUrl_(userId, collection, apiKey) { var actListUrl = ACTIVITYLISTURL; actListUrl = actListUrl.replace(\/{userId}\/, userId); actListUrl = actListUrl.replace(\/{collection}\/, collection); actListUrl += '?key=' + apiKey; actListUrl += '&fields=items\/object\/attachments(url,displayName)'; return actListUrl; }\n\nThat brings us to the end of this part in the series. At this stage we have covered the tasklist determination using a user interface and pulled the URLs posted on a Google+ activity stream, storing them in the sheet.\n\nIn the next part, we\u2019ll look at synchronising the URLs in the sheet with tasks on the chosen tasklist.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n","html":"<p>This is Part 3 in a series about an example app that I put together to demonstrate and describe the use of various Google Apps Script features.

We get a handle on the active sheet, note the last row (which denotes where the list of URLs currently ends), and gets those URLs. We&#8217;re assuming that the list starts at row 2, i.e. there&#8217;s a header line in row 1. The resulting urlList array is two dimensional, although as we&#8217;ve specified we only want 1 column width of values, the data will look something like this:<\/p>\n<pre>[[http:\/\/cloud9ide.com], [http:\/\/jsconf.eu], [...]]<\/pre>\n<p>We create an object to hold the existing (&#8216;old&#8217;) URLs, and the eventual &#8216;new&#8217; URLs about to be retrieved. We&#8217;re using an object &#8216;old&#8217; for the existing URLs so we can easily check whether a new one is in the list or not. We just need to use an array for the &#8216;new&#8217; URLs.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">function retrieveActivityUrls_() {\n\n  \/\/ Grab existing list of URLs\n  var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\n  var lastRow = sh.getLastRow();\n  var urlList = sh.getRange(2, 1, lastRow - 1 || 1) .getValues();\n  var list = {'old': {}, 'new': []};\n  for (var i in urlList){\n    list['old'][urlList[i]] = 1;\n  }<\/pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to retrieve the activity for a Google+ person, and the person is identified by an ID either in a cell in the sheet identified by the range in constant USERIDCELL, (see the screencast in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-1\/\">Part 1<\/a>) or a default specified in constant USERID.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Use the userid in the sheet, fallback to a favourite\n  var userid = sh.getRange(USERIDCELL).getValue() || USERID;<\/pre>\n<p>Now we have enough information to build the Google+ API resource URL, so we call a helper function buildActivityListUrl_() passing it the user ID, the collection (&#8216;public&#8217;), and our API key. (We&#8217;ll look at buildActivityListUrl_() shortly.) We use the UrlFetchApp fetch() method to grab the resource, calling getContentText() to obtain the JSON content. And with a JSON parser available in the <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_utilities.html\">Utilities Services<\/a>, we quickly have all we need to retrieve those URLs posted in the activity list in the &#8216;activities&#8217; object.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Build Google+ API resource and retrieve it; parse JSON content\n  var actListUrl = buildActivityListUrl_(userid, 'public', APIKEY);\n  var jsonString = UrlFetchApp.fetch(actListUrl).getContentText();\n  var activities = Utilities.jsonParse(jsonString);<\/pre>\n<p>From examining the JSON representation of the activities earlier in this post, we know we&#8217;ll be expecting items, and within each item an object member, and within that object member a number of attachments. We&#8217;re only interested in those attachments of type &#8216;article&#8217;, and if we find one, we want the url and the displayName.<\/p>\n<p>If we&#8217;ve got an article attachment, we then need to determine whether it&#8217;s a new URL or one we have already. That&#8217;s where the list object comes in. Unless we can find the URL in the &#8216;old&#8217; object, it&#8217;s a new one so we need to add it to the &#8216;new&#8217; list.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ We're looking for the item object attachments, where the\n  \/\/ attachment's objectType is 'article'. We want the url and displayName\n  for (var i in activities.items) {\n    var attachments = activities.items[i].object.attachments;\n    for (var a in attachments) {\n      var attachment = attachments[a];\n      \/\/ We've got a URL and title; store it as new if it doesn't\n      \/\/ already exist.

(attachment.url in list['old'])) {\n          list['new'].push([attachment.url, attachment.displayName]);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }<\/pre>\n<p>At this stage, we&#8217;re ready to add any new URLs to the list in the sheet. Note that when we pushed onto the &#8216;new&#8217; list, we pushed an array of the url and displayName. This is the ideal two dimensional array ([[a, b], [c, d], [...]) to specify as the value in the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_range.html#setValues\">setValues()<\/a> call on a two dimensional cell Range. And useful if we want to follow the sage advice in &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/guide_common_tasks.html\">Common Programming Tasks<\/a>&#8221; on using batch operations where possible: we can add all the new URL info to the sheet in a single getRange() and setValues() call pair:<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">  \/\/ Blammo!\n  if (list['new'].length) {\n    sh.getRange(lastRow + 1, 1, list['new'].length, 2).setValues(list['new']);\n  }\n\n}<\/pre>\n<p>Now that&#8217;s the retrieveActivityUrls_() \u00a0function out of the way, let&#8217;s just have a look at the helper function buildActivityListUrl_() that we called earlier. It takes three parameters: the ID of the person on Google+, the collection we want to retrieve (&#8216;public&#8217; in this case), and the API key. It uses a URL template in the ACTIVITYLISTURL constant and replaces the placeholders. It also adds the API key, and the XPath fields statement.<\/p>\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">function buildActivityListUrl_(userId, collection, apiKey) {\n\n  var actListUrl = ACTIVITYLISTURL;\n  actListUrl = actListUrl.replace(\/{userId}\/, userId);\n  actListUrl = actListUrl.replace(\/{collection}\/, collection);\n  actListUrl += '?key=' + apiKey;\n  actListUrl += '&amp;fields=items\/object\/attachments(url,displayName)';\n\n  return actListUrl;\n}<\/pre>\n<p>That brings us to the end of this part in the series. At this stage we have covered the tasklist determination using a user interface and pulled the URLs posted on a Google+ activity stream, storing them in the sheet.<\/p>\n<p>In the next part, we&#8217;ll look at synchronising the URLs in the sheet with tasks on the chosen tasklist.<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 19:23:34 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 19:23:34 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 14 Oct 2011 19:23:34 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1170,"title":"Reading List Mark 2 - Part 4","slug":"reading-list-mark-2-part-4","markdown":"\nThis is Part 4 in a series about an example app that I put together to demonstrate and describe the use of various Google Apps Script features.

This part is \u201c**Synchronising the URL list in the spreadsheet with corresponding tasks in the chosen tasklist**\u201c.\n\n**Parts Overview**\n\n1. [Introduction to the app, and a short screencast showing the features](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-1\/)\n2.

[Putting it all together and using the OnOpen event to insert a new 2-item menu entry on the spreadsheet\u2019s page](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-5\/)\n\n**Putting this into context: the Update request**\n\nWe\u2019ve covered a lot of ground in the previous three parts in this series. Now we\u2019re at the stage where we have the functions for\n\n- creating a Ui for choosing an existing \/ creating a new tasklist\n- handling the button event on the Ui\n- getting a list of tasklists\n- retrieving URLs from a Google+ activity stream\n\nSo the one main piece of work outstanding is synchronising the retrieved URLs as tasks on the chosen tasklist.\n\nIf you watch the [screencast](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F08qS8ZmlZ0) shown in\u00a0[Part 1](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-1\/) you\u2019ll see that the synchronisation is part of a more general \u2018update\u2019 request, that includes the fetching of new URLs from Google+ and synchronising them with the tasklist. So let\u2019s have a look at the function that binds those two things together.\n\nHere\u2019s the update() function, which we\u2019ll allow the user to call from a menu item (we\u2019ll cover this in the next instalment).\n\nREADINGLISTCELL = 'D1'; function update() { \/\/ First, check that we have a tasklist id already; it's stored in \/\/ the comment section of the 'readinglistcell' var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet(); var taskListId = sh.getRange(READINGLISTCELL).getComment(); \/\/ If we don't have an id, tell the user to choose a tasklist if(taskListId === '') { SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().toast( \"Use Articles -> Select Task List to choose a task list\", \"No Task List\", 5 ); \/\/ Otherwise, we know which task list to synchronise with, so \/\/ go and update the reading list with URLs from the Google+ activity \/\/ list, and then sync that with the task list items } else { retrieveActivityUrls_(); synchronise_(taskListId); } }\n\nThis function grabs a reference to the active sheet, and pulls the comment from the cell that we\u2019ve designated as where the reading list tasklist info is stored: READINGLISTCELL. The name is stored in the cell, and the ID is stored in the cell\u2019s comment. If there isn\u2019t an ID, then we\u2019ll ask the user to choose a tasklist using the Ui we built in [Part 2](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-2\/). The [Browser](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_browser.html) class in Google Apps Script\u2019s [Base Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_base.html) gives us a nice dialog box that looks like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1198\" style=\"width: 316px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/notamessage1.png \"Message Box\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/notamessage1.png)Message Box\n\n<\/div>But there\u2019s also a nice visual message feature that\u2019s available in the [Spreadsheet Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_spreadsheet.html), specific to a spreadsheet: [toast()](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_spreadsheet.html#toast). Calling this causes a popup to appear in the lower right of the screen, which stays visible for a short while. This is what it looks like:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1177\" style=\"width: 269px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/notasklist.png \"Toast message\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/notasklist.png)Toast message\n\n<\/div>Because the \u2018toast\u2019 name is so evocative, we\u2019ll use it in our function to prompt the user to choose a tasklist.\n\nIf there\u2019s already a tasklist chosen, then we go straight into retrieving the URLs (see [Part 3](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-3\/)) and then call the synchronise_() function, passing the ID of the tasklist.\n\n**Synchronising URLs and Tasks**\n\nOk, so what do we need to do to synchronise the URLs? It\u2019s similar to the technique described in the great article \u201c[Integrating with Google APIs \u2013 Creating a simple reading list](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/articles\/google_apis_reading_list.html)\u201c. There are a couple of differences: I\u2019m not going to use the [UrlShortener Services](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/service_urlshortener.html), and I\u2019m going to try and reduce the number of API calls by bulk-grabbing the cell data.\n\nFirst, we get a range reference on the active sheet, which equates to the list of URLs already there. We get all of the URLs (urlRange.getValues()) and all of the corresponding comments (urlRange.getComments()).\n\nfunction synchronise_(taskListId) { \/\/ Grab list of all URLs, and associated comments var sh = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet(); var urlRange = sh.getRange(2, 1, sh.getLastRow() - 1, 1); var urls = urlRange.getValues(); var comments = urlRange.getComments();\n\nWe go through each of the URLs, and create a new task in the tasklist if there isn\u2019t already something in the comment for that URL:\n\n- instantiate a new task object: Tasks.newTask()\n- add the title: task.setTitle()\n- add the task to the tasklist: Tasks.Tasks.insert()\n- insert the new task\u2019s ID into the comment for the URL: setComment()\n\nOtherwise we\u2019ve already created a task for the URL, so we grab the task to get the status, and if it\u2019s marked as completed, we format the URL and corresponding description (in the next column) to set strike-through text.\n\n \/\/ For each URL, check the status of the associated task. \/\/ If there isn't an associated task, create one. for (var i = 0, j = urls.length; i < j; i++) { if (comments[i] == \"\") { Logger.log(\"New task\"); var task = Tasks.newTask(); task.setTitle(urls[i]); var newTask = Tasks.Tasks.insert(task, taskListId); sh.getRange(i + 2, 1).setComment(newTask.getId()); } else { Logger.log(\"Existing task\"); var existingTask = Tasks.Tasks.get(taskListId, comments[i][0]); if (existingTask.getStatus() === \"completed\") { sh.getRange(i + 2, 1, 1, 2).setFontLine('line-through'); } } } }\n\nThat\u2019s it. Stop by next time for the last part in this series, where we put everything together and insert a 2-item menu entry to tie it all together.

This part is \u201c**Putting it all together and using the OnOpen event to insert a new 2-item menu entry on the spreadsheet\u2019s page**\u201c.\n\n**Parts Overview**\n\n1. [Introduction to the app, and a short screencast showing the features](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2011\/10\/reading-list-mark-2-part-1\/)\n2.

It\u2019s very easy to extend the menu; in a few lines of code we\u2019re going to end up with something like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1202\" style=\"width: 320px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/menu.png \"Menu\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/menu.png)Menu\n\n<\/div>It\u2019s as simple as this:\n\nfunction onOpen() { var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet(); var menuEntries = [ {name: \"Update\", functionName: \"update\"}, {name: \"Select Task List\", functionName: \"taskListUi\"} ]; ss.addMenu(\"Articles\", menuEntries); }\n\nWe use the\u00a0[addMenu](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/class_spreadsheet.html#addMenu)() method of the Spreadsheet class to create a new menu entry with an array of objects representing menu items. And the function name? onOpen() is one of a number of [built-in simple event handler functions](http:\/\/code.google.com\/googleapps\/appsscript\/guide_events.html); this one runs automatically when a spreadsheet is opened \u2013 an ideal time to extend the menu.\n\n**The complete script**\n\nSo we\u2019re done with the final part!

I downloaded it and unpacked the contents into a directory to have a look at the docu and guidelines, and have an initial poke around.\n\nWow, those folks have certainly put together some nice documentation already! Try it for yourself \u2013 once downloaded, open the demokit directory and you should be presented with a nice (SAPUI5-powered) overview, developer guide, controls and API reference:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1323\" style=\"width: 610px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/sapui5overview-300x201.png \"sapui5overview\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/sapui5overview.png)SAPUI5 Demokit Docu\n\n<\/div>The framework is based upon JQuery \/ UI and contains \u00a0a huge number of controls. It also supports data bindings, and one thing that had[ intrigued me](https:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/qmacro\/status\/167191292919545856) from the podcast was that data bindings were possible to arbitrary JSON and XML \u2026 and OData resources.\n\n\u201cGosh\u201d, I hear you say, \u201cthat reminds me of something!\u201d Of course, SAP NetWeaver Gateway\u2019s REST-informed data-centric consumption model is based upon OData. So of course I immediately was curious to learn about SAPUI5 with an OData flavour. How could I try out one of the controls to surface information in OData resources exposed by NetWeaver Gateway?\n\nWhat I ended up with is SAPUI5\u2019s DataTable control filled with travel agency information from my copy of the\u00a0[trial NetWeaver Gateway system](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/sdn\/gateway?rid=\/webcontent\/uuid\/90b292cc-a2d7-2e10-709d-9fba966a6937), via an OData service all ready to use. You can see what I mean in this short [screencast](http:\/\/youtu.be\/yHVuWHNWK3I):\n\n\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to get the pieces together. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve got the trial Gateway system installed and set up (you know, fully qualified hostname, ICM configured nicely, and so on), and that you\u2019re semi-familiar with the SFLIGHT dataset.\n\n### Step 1. The OData Service\n\nCheck with transaction \/iwfnd\/reg_service, for the LOCAL system alias, that the service RMTSAMPLEFLIGHT is available, as shown here.\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/iwfnd_reg_service1.png \"iwfnd_reg_service\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/iwfnd_reg_service1.png)\n\nCheck you can see the service document by clicking the Call Browser button (you may need to provide a user and password for HTTP basic authentication). You can also check the data by manually navigating to the TravelagencyCollection by following the relative href attribute of the app:collection element as shown here:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/travelagencycollection.png \"travelagencycollection\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/travelagencycollection.png)\n\nIn other words, navigate from something like this:\n\nhttp:\/\/gateway.server:port\/sap\/opu\/sdata\/IWFND\/RMTSAMPLEFLIGHT\/?$format=xml\n\nto this:\n\nhttp:\/\/gateway.server:port\/sap\/opu\/sdata\/IWFND\/RMTSAMPLEFLIGHT\/TravelagencyCollection?$format=xml\n\n(The $format=xml is to force the service to return a less exotic Content-Type of application\/xml rather than an Atom-flavoured one, so that the browser is more likely to render the data in human-readable form.)\n\nFollowing this href should show you some actual travel agency data in the form of entries in an Atom feed (yes, \u201ceverything is a collection\/feed!\u201d):\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/atomentry1.png \"atomentry\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/atomentry1.png)\n\n### Step 2. The SAPUI5 Framework\n\nMake your SAPUi5 framework accessible. To avoid Same Origin Policy based issues in your browser, get your Gateway\u2019s ICM to serve the files for you. Create a \u2018sapui5\u2032 directory in your Gateway\u2019s filesystem:\n\n\/usr\/sap\/NPL\/DVEBMGS42\/sapui5\/\n\nunpack the SAPUI5 framework into here, and add an instance profile configuration parameter to tell the ICM to serve files from this location:\n\nicm\/HTTP\/file_access_5 = PREFIX=\/sapui5\/, DOCROOT=$(DIR_INSTANCE)\/sapui5\/, BROWSEDIR=2\n\n(here I have 5 previous file_access_xx parameters, hence the \u20185\u2019 suffix in this example)\n\nand when you restart the ICM it should start serving the framework to you:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/sapui5dir.png \"sapui5dir\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/sapui5dir.png)\n\n### Step 3. The HTML \/ Javascript Application Skeleton\n\nActually, calling it an application is far too grand. But you know what I mean. Now we have the SAPUI5 framework being served, and the OData service available, it\u2019s time to put the two together.\n\nHere\u2019s the general skeleton of the application \u2013 we pull in SAPUI5, and have an element in the body where the control will be placed:\n\n  \u00a0 <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" \/> \u00a0 <title>SAP OData in SAPUI5 Data Table Control<\/title>\n\n <!-- Load SAPUI5, select theme and control libraries --> \u00a0 <script id=\"sap-ui-bootstrap\" \u00a0 \u00a0 type=\"text\/javascript\" \u00a0 \u00a0 src=\"http:\/\/gateway.server:port\/sapui5\/sapui5-static\/resources\/sap-ui-core.js\" \u00a0 \u00a0 data-sap-ui-theme=\"sap_platinum\" \u00a0 \u00a0 data-sap-ui-libs=\"sap.ui.commons,sap.ui.table\"> <\/script> <script> ... <\/script>   \u00a0 <h1>SAP OData in SAPUI5 Data Table Control<\/h1> \u00a0 <div id=\"dataTable\"><\/div>  \n\nIn the final step we\u2019ll have a look at what goes in the \u201c\u2026\u201d bit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Step 4. Using the SAPUI5 Framework in the Application\n\nSo now it\u2019s time to flex our Javascript fingers, stand on the shoulders of giants, and write a few lines of code to invoke the SAPUI5 power and glory.\n\nWhat we need to do is:\n\n- create a DataTable control\n- add columns to it to represent the fields in the OData entries\n- create an OData data model\n- link the DataTable to this data model\n- bind the rows to the TravelagencyCollection\n- place the control on the page\n\nSimples!\n\nCreating the DataTable control goes like this (but you must remember to add the control library to the data-sap-ui-libs attribute when loading SAPUI5 \u2013 see Step 3):\n\nvar oTable = new sap.ui.table.DataTable();\n\nEach column is added and described like this:\n\noTable.addColumn(new sap.ui.table.Column({ \u00a0 label: new sap.ui.commons.Label({text: \"Agency Name\"}), \u00a0 template: new sap.ui.commons.TextView().bindProperty(\"text\", \"NAME\"), \u00a0 sortProperty: \"NAME\" }));\n\nThere are three different templates in use, for different fields \u2013 the basic TextView, the TextField and the Link.\n\nThe OData data model is created like this, where the URL parameter points to the service document:\n\nvar oModel = new sap.ui.model.odata.ODataModel(\"http:\/\/gateway.server:port\/sap\/opu\/sdata\/iwfnd\/RMTSAMPLEFLIGHT\");\n\nIt\u2019s then linked to the control like this:\n\noTable.setModel(oModel);\n\nThe specific OData resource TravelagencyCollection is bound to the control\u2019s rows like this:\n\noTable.bindRows(\"TravelagencyCollection\");\n\nAnd then the control is placed on the page like this:\n\noTable.placeAt(\"dataTable\");\n\nI\u2019ve put the complete code in a Github [Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/1820544) for you to have a look at.\n\n\u00a0\n\n### Result\n\nWhat you end up with is live data from your SAP Gateway system that is presented to you like this:\n\n[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/result.png \"result\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/result.png)\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare and enjoy!\n\n\n","html":"<p>So following a very interesting <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spreaker.com\/page#!\/user\/4440992\/episode_010_sap_s_ui_toolkit_aka_sapui5\">podcast<\/a> from Rui Nogueira with SAP&#8217;s Michael Falk and Tim Back on the HTML5-based UI Toolkit for SAP NetWeaver Gateway (aka &#8220;SAPUI5&#8243;) earlier this month, a beta version of \u00a0SAPUI5 was released to the world on SDN, specifically in the &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/sdn\/sap-technology-innovation?rid=\/webcontent\/uuid\/20a34ae7-762d-2f10-c994-db2e898d5f70\">Developer Center for UI Development Toolkit for HTML5<\/a>&#8221; section.

It was a truly great event \u2013 thousands of SAP developers attending many tracks and sessions on everything from Analytics, through Database & Technology, to Cloud, and more besides. As I sit here in Frankfurt airport on my way home, I\u2019ve been reflecting on perhaps the best single takeaway from this event. Yes the content of the talks was great (and I enjoyed giving my session on SAP NetWeaver Gateway too). Yes the venue and organisation was second to none. Yes it was great to see the SAP Mentor wolfpack and our illustrious leader Mark Finnern.\n\nBut most of all, I saw, felt, and experienced something that I last remember from over 20 years ago in my SAP career:\u00a0*The Developer Connection*.\n\nBack in the day, when I was (more) innocent, certainly a lot younger, and waist-deep in IBM mainframe tech, I moved around implementing and supporting R\/2 installations in the UK and Europe. Esso Petroleum in London, Deutsche Telekom in Euskirchen, and so on. In those days you could catch up with all the OSS notes on your favourite topics over a couple of coffees. Most importantly however, you had connections to the developers at SAP who were building and shipping the code that you were implementing. We knew each other\u2019s names, and in many cases, shared phone numbers or email addresses too. There was a strong bond between customers and developers \u2013 and we worked together to make the software better.\n\nThat connection lost its way over the next few years, when SAP (consciously or unconsiously) built barriers between us. It became almost impossible in some cases to even find out the name of the developer or team responsible, let alone contact them directly.\n\nWell \u2013 that connection is back. And better than ever before. Both at SAP TechEd Madrid, and this week at DKOM, developers were coming and saying hello.

It was a truly great event &#8211; thousands of SAP developers attending many tracks and sessions on everything from Analytics, through Database &amp; Technology, to Cloud, and more besides. As I sit here in Frankfurt airport on my way home, I&#8217;ve been reflecting on perhaps the best single takeaway from this event. Yes the content of the talks was great (and I enjoyed giving my session on SAP NetWeaver Gateway too). Yes the venue and organisation was second to none. Yes it was great to see the SAP Mentor wolfpack and our illustrious leader Mark Finnern.<\/p>\n<p>But most of all, I saw, felt, and experienced something that I last remember from over 20 years ago in my SAP career:\u00a0<em>The Developer Connection<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the day, when I was (more) innocent, certainly a lot younger, and waist-deep in IBM mainframe tech, I moved around implementing and supporting R\/2 installations in the UK and Europe. Esso Petroleum in London, Deutsche Telekom in Euskirchen, and so on. In those days you could catch up with all the OSS notes on your favourite topics over a couple of coffees. Most importantly however, you had connections to the developers at SAP who were building and shipping the code that you were implementing. We knew each other&#8217;s names, and in many cases, shared phone numbers or email addresses too. There was a strong bond between customers and developers &#8211; and we worked together to make the software better.<\/p>\n<p>That connection lost its way over the next few years, when SAP (consciously or unconsiously) built barriers between us. It became almost impossible in some cases to even find out the name of the developer or team responsible, let alone contact them directly.<\/p>\n<p>Well &#8211; that connection is back. And better than ever before. Both at SAP TechEd Madrid, and this week at DKOM, developers were coming and saying hello. Developers who are building the great stuff we&#8217;re exploring and using, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/sdn\/index?rid=\/webcontent\/uuid\/20a34ae7-762d-2f10-c994-db2e898d5f70\">SAPUI5<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/netweaver-gateway\">NetWeaver Gateway<\/a>.

Firebase, an offering still in beta, [with some features pending](http:\/\/www.firebase.com\/faq.html), has come along and seems to be delivering that. With style. Style not only in the actual UX, but in the design approach. In a recent talk on [SAP NetWeaver Gateway](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/netweaver-gateway) at the SAP Developers Kick-Off Meeting ([DKOM](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Opmj8M_tBw)) in Karlsruhe, I had a slide that simply said:\n\n> Everything is a resource\n\nThis is a key tenet that underpins the values of REST and related directions in information architecture: that if a piece of data (or, indirectly, a business function, for that matter) is important, you should give it a name, an address \u2013 [make it a first class\u00a0citizen on the web](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2009\/06\/information-vs-behaviour\/). From there, everything else follows. You can manipulate it, you can describe it, and you can link to it.\n\nWith Firebase, each piece of JSON data you store in the backend gets its own URL. Each object, array, element and attribute is automatically given an address, as you create them. You can manipulate the data via the [Javascript library](http:\/\/www.firebase.com\/docs\/), through a [REST API](http:\/\/www.firebase.com\/docs\/rest-api.html) and also through a lovely graphical debugger that looks like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1401\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/FirebaseGraphicalDebugger-300x163.png \"Firebase Graphical Debugger\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/FirebaseGraphicalDebugger.png)Firebase Graphical Debugger\n\n<\/div>**Firebase Graphical Debugger**\n\nWith the debugger you can manipulate the data directly too. What I\u2019m guessing, through the way that the Debugger operates, is that the Debugger itself is powered by Firebase. When data in the data set that you\u2019re viewing is changed \u2013 whether that change is initiated via the REST API or activity in a Firebase-powered application, the view in the debugger is automatically updated to show that change.\n\n**Event system**\n\nWhich brings me on to the other part of Firebase that\u2019s important \u2013 the event system. Reading data from Firebase in your Javascript application is done by attaching asynchronous callbacks to a data location. These callbacks are triggered on data events like \u2018value\u2019, \u2018child_added\u2019, \u2018child_changed\u2019 and so on. So a very simple setup to be able to show when a new record was added to a dataset would be as simple as:\n\n- Instantiating a new Firebase object, pointing to the URL of the data set\n- Associating a callback function to the \u2018child_added\u2019 event, to receive, unpack and use the new record\n\nLike this:\n\n**var dataRef = new Firebase('http:\/\/demo.firebase.com\/[...]299148\/[...]QULZ4snBB\/');**\n\n**dataRef.on('child_added', function(snapshot) { var data = snapshot.val(); \/\/ ... }**\n\n**Screencast: Stupid Firebase and SAPUI5 Tricks**\n\nOn Saturday evening I had a little hack around, and found developing with Firebase fun as well as interesting. I put together a little screencast \u201c[Stupid Firebase and SAPUI5 tricks](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Obh2LW7CCKY)\u201c. I have been investigating the [SAP UI Development Toolkit for HTML5](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/sdn\/index?rid=\/webcontent\/uuid\/20a34ae7-762d-2f10-c994-db2e898d5f70) (aka SAPUI5) for a short while now, and thought it would be an interesting exercise to hook up some data events powered by Firebase with an SAPUI5 [DataTable](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/~dj\/sapui5\/demokit\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.table.DataTable.html). And throw my favourite environment \u2013 the Unix command line \u2013 into the mix too.  \n \u00a0  \n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Obh2LW7CCKY\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe>  \n \u00a0  \n As I didn\u2019t speak over the screencast, I thought I\u2019d provide an annotation here.\n\n1. We start out with a view of the Firebase Graphical Debugger showing a data set at a given URL. The data set contains a number of nodes, each node has an identifier which is used in forming that node\u2019s unique URL\n2. On the Unix command line, I use [cURL](http:\/\/curl.haxx.se) \u2013 a great command line HTTP client \u2013 to effectively remove the data, by making an HTTP PUT to the data set\u2019s URL, supplying an empty JSON stucture as the payload. As you can see, the data disappeared immediately in the Graphical Debugger, as the event triggered the Javascript function to remove the data from the display to reflect the snapshot stored at the backend\n3. A simple SAPUI5 DataTable is revealed in another window, empty, with three columns for some data we\u2019re going to see appear there; data based on the standard Apache access log (source IP address, relative path of URL requested, and status code)\n4. We go back to the Unix command line, and use a combination of tail, perl and some core bash shell features to pull some data out of my web server\u2019s access log, turn it into JSON, and make HTTP POST requests to the data set stored by Firebase\n5. Before we actually complete and execute that command pipeline, we have a quick look at the SAPUI5 and Firebase Javascript behind the DataTable, showing the relationship between the DataTable fields and what we\u2019re expecting in the \u2018child_added\u2019 Firebase data event\n6. Finally we execute the command pipeline and see immediately that not only the Graphical Debugger is updated to show the records that were added to the data set at that URL, but also the DataTable receives the data as intended.\n\nThere really is little merit in this experiment; what was important for me was to see Firebase in action, and to learn something about the philosophy of the framework. I really liked what I\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start, there are some features still missing from Firebase \u2013 most notably security. So you\u2019re completely at liberty right now to read those URLs from the screencast and start hacking with my demo data. But why do that?

Please try to open the connection with Sesame installed on the desktop. If you are the owner of the OData feed, try to add a clientaccesspolicy.xml file on the server.--\n\nSo, how to make these two cross domain access files available, and specifically from the root? There have been some thoughts on this already, [using a default service on the ICF\u2019s default host definition](http:\/\/www.plinky.it\/blog\/2009\/03\/09\/add-crossdomainxml-on-the-root-of-sap-web-application-server\/), or even dynamically loading the XML as a file into the server cache (see the ABAP program in [this thread in the RIA dev forum](http:\/\/forums.sdn.sap.com\/thread.jspa?threadID=281050)).\n\nBut a conversation on Twitter last night about BSPs, raw ICF and even the ICM reminded me that the ICM is a powerful engine that is often overlooked and underloved. The ICM \u2014 Internet Communication Manager \u2014 is the collection of core HTTP\/SMTP\/plugin services that sits underneath the ICF, and handle the actual HTTP traffic below the level of the ICF\u2019s ABAP layer. In the style of [Apache handlers](http:\/\/httpd.apache.org\/docs\/trunk\/handler.html), there are a series of handlers that the ICM has to deal with plenty of HTTP serving situations \u2013 Logging, Authentication, Server Cache, Administration, Modification, File Access, Redirect, as well as the \u201cABAP\u201d handler we know as the ICF layer.\n\nCould the humble ICM help with serving these two XML resources?\u00a0Of course it could!\n\nThe File Access handler is what we recognise from the level 2 trace info in the dev_icm tracefile as HttpFileAccessHandler. You all read the verbose traces from the ICM with your morning coffee, right? Just kidding. Anyway, the File Access handler makes its features available to us in the form of the [icm\/HTTP\/file_access_<xx>](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/saphelp_nw70ehp2\/helpdata\/en\/48\/3e1b4e252f72d0e10000000a42189c\/frameset.htm) profile parameters. It allows us to point the ICM at a directory on the filesystem and have it serve files directly, if a URL is matched. Note that this File Access handler is invoked, and given a chance to respond, before we even get to the ABAP handler\u2019s ICF level.\n\nWith a couple of these file_access parameters, we can serve static clientaccesspolicy.xml and crossdomain.xml files straight from the filesystem, matched at root. Here\u2019s what I have in my \/usr\/sap\/NPL\/SYS\/profile\/NPL_DVEBMGS42_nplhost parameter file:\n\nicm\/HTTP\/file_access_1 = PREFIX=\/clientaccesspolicy.xml, DOCROOT=$(DIR_INSTANCE)\/qmacro, DIRINDEX=clientaccesspolicy.xml icm\/HTTP\/file_access_2 = PREFIX=\/crossdomain.xml, DOCROOT=$(DIR_INSTANCE)\/qmacro, DIRINDEX=crossdomain.xml\n\n(I already have file_access_0 specifying something else not relevant here).\n\nWhat are these parameters saying? Well the PREFIX specifies the relative URL to match, the DOCROOT specifies the directory that the ICM is to serve files from in response to requests matching the PREFIX, and DIRINDEX is a file to serve when the \u2018index\u2019 is requested. Usually the PREFIX is used to specify a directory, or a relative URL representing a \u2018container\u2019, so the DIRINDEX value is what\u2019s served when there\u2019s a request for exactly that container. The upshot is that the relevant file is served for the right relative resource. The files are in directory \/usr\/sap\/NPL\/DVEBMGS42\/qmacro\/.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, we might as well specify a similar File Access handler parameter to serve the favicon, not least because that will prevent those pesky warnings about not being able to serve requests for that resource, if you don\u2019t have one already:\n\nicm\/HTTP\/file_access_3 = PREFIX=\/favicon.ico, DOCROOT=$(DIR_INSTANCE)\/qmacro, DIRINDEX=favicon.ico\n\nThe upshot of all this is that the static XML resources are served directly by the ICM, without the request even having to permeate up as far as the ABAP stack:\n\n[Thr 139708142688000] Handler 5: HttpFileAccessHandler matches url: \/clientaccesspolicy.xml [Thr 139708142688000] HttpSubHandlerCall: Call Handler: HttpFileAccessHandler (1089830\/1088cf0), task=TASK_REQUEST(1), header_len=407 [Thr 139708142688000] HttpFileAccessHandler: access file\/dir: \/usr\/sap\/NPL\/DVEBMGS42\/qmacro [Thr 139708142688000] HttpFileAccessHandler: file \/usr\/sap\/NPL\/DVEBMGS42\/qmacro\/clientaccesspolicy.xml modified: -1\/1326386676 [Thr 139708142688000] HttpSubHandlerItDeactivate: handler 4: HttpFileAccessHandler [Thr 139708142688000] HttpSubHandlerClose: Call Handler: HttpFileAccessHandler (1089830\/1088cf0), task=TASK_CLOSE(3)\n\nand also that the browser-based Sesame Data Browser can access your Gateway OData resources successfully:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1311\" style=\"width: 459px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/SesameDataBrowserScreenshot.png \"SesameDataBrowserScreenshot\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/SesameDataBrowserScreenshot.png)Data Browser\n\n<\/div>\u00a0\n\nSuccess!\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the Internet Communication Manager (ICM) and the Internet Communication Framework (ICF), you might be interested in my\u00a0[Omniversity of Manchester](http:\/\/omniversity.madlab.org.uk) course:\n\n### [Web Programming with SAP\u2019s Internet Communication Framework](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/pub?id=1gaTCzfuisyG0UyZE70RrxiltoC1zcSSaM2iMHqN5mjY)\n\nWhich is currently running in [March (3rd and 4th)](http:\/\/s.madlab.org.uk\/sap2) and [May (9th and 10th)](http:\/\/s.madlab.org.uk\/sap3) in Manchester.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;m totally enamoured by the power and potential of SAP&#8217;s <a href=\"www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/sdn\/gateway\">NetWeaver Gateway<\/a>, and all it has to offer with its REST-informed data-centric consumption model.

I say 30 years ago because the last time I remember this sort of passion and interest was when I used to attend a local computer club, where members showed their latest hardware and software projects based on micros like the\u00a0[Acorn Atom](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2005\/11\/acorn-atom-and-my-start-in-computing\/) and others of that era. Home-made cases, low-level programming and soldering were the norm, and are the norm again.\n\nOne of my interests is retrocomputing, in particular, serial terminals. I had a great collection of them a while ago (VT320s, VT330+s, VT420s, and various Wyse models) all connected to multiple serial ports in the back of a Linux box (the serial signals actually running over Cat5 and re-converted at the patch-panel end, but that\u2019s another story). Sadly I no longer have any of these terminals (another story again) but my friend [Robert Shiels](http:\/\/se71.org) recently donated a [Wyse WY-30](https:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/221552947266453505) to me. Joseph and I decided to bring it along to the Raspberry Jam and do a show-n-tell on connecting it up to the Pi. The ultimate goal is to have a standalone serial terminal, good looking enough and retro enough to have in the living room, with a Raspberry Pi actually inside it, with a serial cable connection to connect, and a wifi adapter to hop on to the local network and from then on to the Internet. A silent, 80\u00d724 green screen connection to life, the universe and everything.\n\n**Making the serial connection**\n\n****\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1458\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_1050171-300x225.jpg \"Raspberry Pi\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_1050171.jpg)Raspberry Pi\n\n<\/div>First things first. The Pi has 2 rows of general purpose input \/ output (GPIO) pins at 3.3V (top left in the picture), but that means that we can\u2019t use an RS232 serial connection directly as the voltage levels are too high. Rather than build or buy a converter, we used a simpler method. Most modern Linux distributions, including Debian Squeeze, provide support for USB serial ports, so getting hold of a USB serial cable was the first job. This connects to one of the USB ports on the Pi, and has a 9 pin D serial connector on the other end.\n\nBooting up the Pi with the USB serial cable connection shows this:\n\nraspberrypi kernel: usbserial: USB Serial Driver core raspberrypi kernel: USB Serial support registered for pl2303 raspberrypi kernel: pl2303 1-1.3:1.0: pl2303 converter detected raspberrypi kernel: usb 1-1.3: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0\n\nAha! ttyUSB0. This means we have a device handle that we can use.\n\nConnecting the USB serial cable to the terminal won\u2019t work directly; we need to have the RX and TX connections reversed (so that RX sends to TX and vice versa). A handy null-modem cable will sort this out for us. So at this point we have Pi USB -> serial connector -> null-modem cable -> terminal.\n\n**Getting the login prompt**\n\nConnecting the terminal to the USB serial port is one thing; getting a login prompt on it requires more work. This is where the lowly \u2018getty\u2019 (from \u2018get teletype\u2019) program comes in. Getty is from a long-gone era of physical teletypes and text terminals, and is used to manage these terminals by listening for a connection, displaying a login prompt, and running the login program to authenticate a user.\n\nGetty needs to know a few things: what serial port to listen for a connection on, what speed the connection is expected to be at, and what terminal type the remote terminal is.\n\nThe invocation of getty we will use (as root) is this:\n\n\/sbin\/agetty -L ttyUSB0 19200 wy30\n\n(I\u2019m actually using agetty here, an alternative getty program with some useful extra features).\n\nThis says: listen on ttyUSB0 for a connection, at baud rate 19200, don\u2019t bother with carrier detect (i.e. force the line to be local), and set the terminal type to be wy30.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got the serial cable connection right, and you\u2019ve configured the terminal settings to be 19200 (at 8N1, i.e. 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), you should see this on the terminal:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1452\" style=\"width: 235px\">[![](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/IMG_20120708_131014-225x300.jpg \"Login prompt on the WY-30\")](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/IMG_20120708_131014.jpg)Login prompt on the WY-30\n\n<\/div>Wonderful!\n\nOne thing you probably want is to have getty listen out for a serial terminal connection all the time, from boot. To do this, add a line to \/etc\/inittab like this:\n\nT0:23:respawn:\/sbin\/agetty -L ttyUSB0 19200 wy30\n\nThis means you can disconnect and reconnect on your terminal at will.\n\n**Adapting the terminal settings**\n\nArguably the most common terminal standard is VT100. This came from the DEC terminals of yore, and through popularity became the de facto standard that OEM terminals emulated, and it\u2019s what software terminals such as [PuTTY](http:\/\/www.chiark.greenend.org.uk\/~sgtatham\/putty\/) will emulate for you too. The Wyse WY-30 that we have has a terminal standard, or \u2018personality\u2019 which is \u2018WY30+\u2019. It will also emulate TVI910+, TVI925 and ADDS A2. Not a VT100. So that\u2019s why we specify \u2018wy30\u2032 on the getty invocation.\n\nBut that specification won\u2019t work unless the Pi knows how to speak WY30, and for that, the terminfo database is used.

I say 30 years ago because the last time I remember this sort of passion and interest was when I used to attend a local computer club, where members showed their latest hardware and software projects based on micros like the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2005\/11\/acorn-atom-and-my-start-in-computing\/\">Acorn Atom<\/a> and others of that era. Home-made cases, low-level programming and soldering were the norm, and are the norm again.<\/p>\n<p>One of my interests is retrocomputing, in particular, serial terminals. I had a great collection of them a while ago (VT320s, VT330+s, VT420s, and various Wyse models) all connected to multiple serial ports in the back of a Linux box (the serial signals actually running over Cat5 and re-converted at the patch-panel end, but that&#8217;s another story). Sadly I no longer have any of these terminals (another story again) but my friend <a href=\"http:\/\/se71.org\">Robert Shiels<\/a> recently donated a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/221552947266453505\">Wyse WY-30<\/a> to me. Joseph and I decided to bring it along to the Raspberry Jam and do a show-n-tell on connecting it up to the Pi. The ultimate goal is to have a standalone serial terminal, good looking enough and retro enough to have in the living room, with a Raspberry Pi actually inside it, with a serial cable connection to connect, and a wifi adapter to hop on to the local network and from then on to the Internet. A silent, 80&#215;24 green screen connection to life, the universe and everything.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Making the serial connection<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1458\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_1050171.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1458\" title=\"Raspberry Pi\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_1050171-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Raspberry Pi<\/p><\/div>\n<p><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First things first. The Pi has 2 rows of general purpose input \/ output (GPIO) pins at 3.3V (top left in the picture), but that means that we can&#8217;t use an RS232 serial connection directly as the voltage levels are too high. Rather than build or buy a converter, we used a simpler method. Most modern Linux distributions, including Debian Squeeze, provide support for USB serial ports, so getting hold of a USB serial cable was the first job. This connects to one of the USB ports on the Pi, and has a 9 pin D serial connector on the other end.<\/p>\n<p>Booting up the Pi with the USB serial cable connection shows this:<\/p>\n<pre>raspberrypi kernel: usbserial: USB Serial Driver core\nraspberrypi kernel: USB Serial support registered for pl2303\nraspberrypi kernel: pl2303 1-1.3:1.0: pl2303 converter detected\nraspberrypi kernel: usb 1-1.3: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0<\/pre>\n<p>Aha! ttyUSB0. This means we have a device handle that we can use.<\/p>\n<p>Connecting the USB serial cable to the terminal won&#8217;t work directly; we need to have the RX and TX connections reversed (so that RX sends to TX and vice versa). A handy null-modem cable will sort this out for us. So at this point we have Pi USB -&gt; serial connector -&gt; null-modem cable -&gt; terminal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting the login prompt<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Connecting the terminal to the USB serial port is one thing; getting a login prompt on it requires more work. This is where the lowly &#8216;getty&#8217; (from &#8216;get teletype&#8217;) program comes in. Getty is from a long-gone era of physical teletypes and text terminals, and is used to manage these terminals by listening for a connection, displaying a login prompt, and running the login program to authenticate a user.<\/p>\n<p>Getty needs to know a few things: what serial port to listen for a connection on, what speed the connection is expected to be at, and what terminal type the remote terminal is.<\/p>\n<p>The invocation of getty we will use (as root) is this:<\/p>\n<pre>\/sbin\/agetty -L ttyUSB0 19200 wy30<\/pre>\n<p>(I&#8217;m actually using agetty here, an alternative getty program with some useful extra features).<\/p>\n<p>This says: listen on ttyUSB0 for a connection, at baud rate 19200, don&#8217;t bother with carrier detect (i.e. force the line to be local), and set the terminal type to be wy30.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve got the serial cable connection right, and you&#8217;ve configured the terminal settings to be 19200 (at 8N1, i.e. 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), you should see this on the terminal:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1452\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/IMG_20120708_131014.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1452\" title=\"Login prompt on the WY-30\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/IMG_20120708_131014-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Login prompt on the WY-30<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Wonderful!<\/p>\n<p>One thing you probably want is to have getty listen out for a serial terminal connection all the time, from boot. To do this, add a line to \/etc\/inittab like this:<\/p>\n<pre>T0:23:respawn:\/sbin\/agetty -L ttyUSB0 19200 wy30<\/pre>\n<p>This means you can disconnect and reconnect on your terminal at will.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Adapting the terminal settings<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Arguably the most common terminal standard is VT100. This came from the DEC terminals of yore, and through popularity became the de facto standard that OEM terminals emulated, and it&#8217;s what software terminals such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chiark.greenend.org.uk\/~sgtatham\/putty\/\">PuTTY<\/a> will emulate for you too. The Wyse WY-30 that we have has a terminal standard, or &#8216;personality&#8217; which is &#8216;WY30+&#8217;. It will also emulate TVI910+, TVI925 and ADDS A2. Not a VT100. So that&#8217;s why we specify &#8216;wy30&#8242; on the getty invocation.<\/p>\n<p>But that specification won&#8217;t work unless the Pi knows how to speak WY30, and for that, the terminfo database is used. Terminfo is a library of escape sequences for manipulating display terminals. Moving the cursor around, clearing the screen, that sort of thing. Termcap is a similar library that predates terminfo.<\/p>\n<p>The Debian Squeeze distribution that was put together for the Pi doesn&#8217;t include the terminfo database, but a quick apt-get invocation later, and we have it:<\/p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install ncurses-term<\/pre>\n<p>Now we have the wy30 entry in the database, as a file &#8216;wy30&#8242; in \/usr\/share\/terminfo\/w\/.<\/p>\n<p>With the file containing the appropriate escape codes to control a Wyse WY-30 terminal available in terminfo, and the specification of &#8216;wy30&#8242; in the getty call, we have all we need to start a productive session on the serially attached terminal.<\/p>\n<p>Rebooting to check that the init spawning of getty is working correctly, and we can log in at our Wyse terminal and use tools such as top, vi, tmux and others that manipulate the screen, without problem.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1455\" style=\"width: 235px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_105411.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1455\" title=\"Vi running in a tmux session\" src=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/20120715_105411-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vi running in a tmux session<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Success!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 09:56:40 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 09:56:40 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Sun, 15 Jul 2012 09:56:40 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1461,"title":"Recent Interests","slug":"recent-interests","markdown":"\nI fed the latest posts from this weblog to Wordle and this is what it came up with as a representation of my recent interests.\n\n[![Wordle: My Recent Interests](http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/thumb\/wrdl\/5540152\/My_Recent_Interests)](http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/show\/wrdl\/5540152\/My_Recent_Interests \"Wordle: My Recent Interests\")\n\n\n","html":"<p>I fed the latest posts from this weblog to Wordle and this is what it came up with as a representation of my recent interests.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"Wordle: My Recent Interests\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/show\/wrdl\/5540152\/My_Recent_Interests\"><img style=\"padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #ddd;\" src=\"http:\/\/www.wordle.net\/thumb\/wrdl\/5540152\/My_Recent_Interests\" alt=\"Wordle: My Recent Interests\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 03 Aug 2012 10:34:23 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Aug 2012 10:34:23 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 03 Aug 2012 10:34:23 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1471,"title":"The Silent Club and Recharging Alone","slug":"the-silent-club-and-recharging-alone","markdown":"\nA month back, [Emma Mulqueeny](http:\/\/twitter.com\/hubmum) [wrote about her Silent Club](http:\/\/mulqueeny.wordpress.com\/2012\/10\/24\/the-silent-club\/).

But it\u2019s also to do with my interest in Google+, and wanting to see that platform and community succeed. I like the idea of Google+ and despite it only having a read-only API for now, I\u2019m encouraged by the direction in which it\u2019s being grown.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy to take 30 days off Twitter, that\u2019s for sure.

It&#8217;s not an attempt to be online less and interacting socially less. The thoughts were initially triggered with the nosedive Twitter&#8217;s standing took in the developer community when they poked a blunt stick in the faces of some of the very developers that helped Twitter succeed, by changing the API usage terms. But it&#8217;s also to do with my interest in Google+, and wanting to see that platform and community succeed. I like the idea of Google+ and despite it only having a read-only API for now, I&#8217;m encouraged by the direction in which it&#8217;s being grown.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not going to be easy to take 30 days off Twitter, that&#8217;s for sure. Many of my friends and work colleagues hang out on Twitter and I get a lot of Instapaper fodder there too. But perhaps a move to Google+ will help me make my mind up once and for all whether it&#8217;s a viable new platform to replace what I use Twitter for. I&#8217;m not expecting other people to make the move, or at least give Google+ a try, but if they do, that&#8217;s great.<\/p>\n<p>Ok, so today I tweeted &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/286442992393404416\">I&#8217;m intending this to be my last (non-automated!)

The club is after school on Friday afternoons and each session runs for an hour. We\u2019re taking a break brought on by the Easter holidays, and I\u2019m on holiday this week too, so I thought I\u2019d put some thoughts together on how it\u2019s gone so far.\u00a0Overall, it\u2019s been a fantastic experience, if slightly chaotic and exhausting (in a good way) at times. The rewards of seeing enthusiasm and interest in the CodeClubbers, and above all their progress, have been great.\n\nAfter registering my interest as a volunteer last year, I didn\u2019t get round to contacting a school until December, where I approached Woodhouses Primary, as it was in the village where I lived. I\u2019d got my CRB check done back in September, via [STEMnet](http:\/\/www.stemnet.org.uk), as advised by CodeClub, and that was a very straightforward process. In fact, I\u2019m as much [involved as a STEMnet Ambassador](http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2012\/12\/codeclub-and-becoming-a-stem-ambassador\/) now as I am a CodeClub leader. Definitely worth looking into!\n\nThe [CodeClub website](http:\/\/www.codeclub.org.uk) had some great [resources](http:\/\/www.codeclub.org.uk\/start-a-club\/volunteers) to help build a case to put to a school, and good notes for volunteers on what to do, what to expect and even ideas on what to say (if you were unsure). I arranged a meeting with the Headteacher and Year 6\u2019s Form teacher, and as soon as I explained what it was, how it worked, and that it was free, the deal was done. The following week I stood up in front of Year 5 and Year 6 children with [some simple slides](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1JvXiFUEf8oxHXwwKtnDBqOd3PhnDau5G_37fAlBQpQ0\/edit?usp=sharing) and explained what programming was all about. At the end, when I asked who might be interested in becoming a member of an after-school CodeClub, there were a lot of raised hands!\n\nThe school decided to restrict the availability to Year 6 children only, because of sheer numbers, and to give the Year 5 children something to look forward to! After all was said and done, I ended up with a total of 13 CodeClubbers.\n\nHere are some bite-sized thoughts on my experience so far.\n\n- **Hardware**: I was somewhat (pleasantly) surprised that the school had enough laptops and desktops to go round. However, they were, understandably, in pretty poor shape, many suffering from performance issues, Windows update issues, and some would randomly refuse to boot.\n- **Access**: Further, each child had their own login, with restricted access. This meant that I had to get admin access to each of the machines to be able to install Scratch. This went well, generally, although some of the installs ended up with no icon on the child\u2019s desktop, meaning we had to go and find the Scratch executable (c:Program Files\u2026) to start it up in some cases.\n- **Saving**: children each had their own area (network-served home directory) to save files, so we use that to save their Scratch work each week. Access to the Web was possible, but via a proxy, the credentials to which have remained somewhat elusive, so we haven\u2019t shared any projects on MIT\u2019s Scratch community site yet. At least, not by direct upload from the Scratch environment (there are proxy and other config parameters you can set if you know the details).\n- **Time**: There were already a number of after school clubs active, but a Friday slot was free. This was ideal, as for me it meant I could choose that slot as the least likely time to impact my day job (more on that later) \u2013 I travel with work sometimes, but Friday is the day I\u2019m most likely to be in Manchester. \u201cAfter school\u201d does not equate to \u201cafter work\u201d, as the former starts usually around 15:15!\n- **Setup**: Some setup time each week is essential, to get the laptops out, arrange the desks and chairs, and get the worksheets ready (having a last look at the task in hand yourself, too!). So I try to arrive at 15:00 for a 15:15 CodeClub start. This also gives me time to think about what the key characteristics of the project are, so I can bind in some emphasis of those points during the session.\n- **Materials**: CodeClub has done a great job of putting materials together for the leaders. There are volunteers that put together projects on a term by term basis. Term 1 is Scratch-based, and what I\u2019m teaching. For Term 1 there are three sets of three projects (i.e. 9 in total), and each project is about the size of a single CodeClub session. Some children finish sooner, others need more than a single session (this does get challenging sometimes, see later). There\u2019s a [sample project available on the CodeClub website](http:\/\/codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/codeclub-whackawitch.pdf).\n- **Belonging**: There are non-programming resources in the CodeClub materials \u2013 such as name badges, door signs and so on. These are wonderful, especially with the CodeClub branding, and I\u2019ve used these to good effect to create a sense of club-style belonging. And as the CodeClub-supplied materials suggest, name badges are ideal for helping you remember each child\u2019s name! A sense of belonging is heightened when you give children little tasks that they can own; I have a badge monitor (distributing and collecting them before and after each session), a door-sign monitor, and so on. And of course, getting them to start and end each session with an almighty \u201cCodeClub\u201d cry is as bonding as it is deafening!\n- **Ratio**: CodeClub recommended around 10 children per volunteer. There\u2019s only me at Woodhouses CodeClub so far, and I have 13. I would agree with CodeClub\u2019s recommendation. While I\u2019m just about coping, it does get a little hectic sometimes, as there are always plenty of questions, the children go at different paces, and it\u2019s sometimes hard to get the balance right between spending quality time on an answer with one child and covering as many questions as possible in the shortest time. Overall, I\u2019ve found that you soon get to recognise those that need more help generally, and those that are more independent. Bear that in mind, and above all, use praise a lot. It really boosts their confidence which in turn edges them further along the continuum from reliance towards independence.\n- **Space**: One thing that caught me completely by surprise was room logistics. The room we have at Woodhouses is long but narrow, and the way the desks and chairs are arranged (there\u2019s only one way, really) means that when the children are in the chairs, it\u2019s quite difficult sometimes for an adult-sized person to squeeze past. This becomes a real issue when you\u2019re trying to flit between as many children as you can answering questions and helping out. If you can bear this in mind when arranging the table logistics, it will help you a lot more than you think.\n- **Enthusiasm**: Year 6 children are excitable and their enthusiasm shows itself in ways that we might initially think are disruptive and chaotic. With the graphical nature of Scratch, this chaos is extended into the projects themselves, with more or less every child wanting to use a different name, character or sprite costume for the project protagonists. Embrace it, don\u2019t fight it. The only thing you should do is be consistent in the naming, so for example the two characters in the first project are a cat called Felix and a mouse called Herbert. What\u2019s certain is that in many cases you\u2019ll neither have cats or mice, nor the names Felix & Herbert. But use \u2018Felix\u2019 and \u2018Herbert\u2019 consistently when you\u2019re explaining things and the children will naturally translate into whatever they have.\n- **Co-Working**: Some children like to work together, others like to work alone. But for any emergency logistical reasons (laptop won\u2019t boot) you can put them together and they won\u2019t mind. Some children are also keen to help out, so embrace that and give them tasks (e.g. help the child next to them find the right sprite costume) and they will thank you for it.\n- **Checkboxes**: Each project worksheet has checkboxes that are designed to be checked off as each child completes that part (one worksheet per child). I forgot to specify that the children should come with pencils or pens on the first session, with the result that some of them, after an interruption, couldn\u2019t find where they\u2019d got to, and it took a little bit of time to work out where they were. So make sure they bring pencils to tick off each section as they do it. It helps them, but it also helps you when coming to answer a question.\n- **Extras**: Be prepared, or be ready to think on your feet. There\u2019s a couple of girls that work together in our CodeClub, and they\u2019re super keen and also very very competent. They just \u201cget it\u201d (e.g. I found myself explaining things to them with the use of the standard Scratch XY Coordinate stage background, possibly too advanced for some, and they loved it). They\u2019re starting to consistently finish the projects before the end of the CodeClub session. There are great \u2018bonus\u2019 tasks on the project handouts, which faster children can do, but I found myself having to give them completely new extra tasks to do to satisfy their hunger for learning and experimentation. So play around with Scratch yourself in between CodeClub sessions and you\u2019ll be more readily able to come up with new small tasks at the drop of a hat.\n- **Flexibility**: Be flexible and creative, too. I discovered that some of the desktop machines had faulty speakers, so the sounds that some of the characters were to make were no good. Rather than have the children disappointed, I encouraged them to \u201chack\u201d the project by getting the characters to \u201csay\u201d or \u201cthink\u201d (speech\/thought bubbles) something instead. They loved it, as they were doing something special.\n- **Assets**: One of the early Scratch projects involves image and sound asset files that are not part of the standard Scratch installation. They are, instead, supplied in the files made available for the CodeClub leaders. This is great, but one mistake I made was not loading the assets onto the laptops before the start of that project session, which meant that some time was wasted distributing them on a USB stick. So remember to check what the project requirements are before you start!\n- **Coordination**: The biggest challenge for me as the only volunteer (somewhat exacerbated by having 13 children) is that the varied pace of progress means that some children are finishing off the previous week\u2019s project while others are starting the new one. This, combined with the room logistics, has been the toughest challenge for me. Keeping track of who is doing what, and therefore in what context to answer each question, is hard. What I want to avoid at all costs is for someone to get bored, either waiting for me to get round to answering their question, or because they\u2019ve finished something and are waiting for new instruction. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an easy answer to this except perhaps to recruit a second volunteer (I\u2019m in the process of doing that now!).\n- **Certificates**: One of the highlights for me has been the reward of Level 1 certificates for those children who\u2019d managed to complete all three projects of Level 1 before Easter. Again, the CodeClub materials are fantastic and a nice A4 landscape certificate with the child\u2019s name hand-written on it and handed out in assembly can only be a good thing, not only for the recipients, but for CodeClub and programming in general.\n- **Highlights**: As well as the specific highlights like certificate awards, there are many weekly highlights for me. Here\u2019s just one example. A child, who\u2019d enthusiastically suggested \u201cBinary!\u201d as a programming language in answer to one of my questions in the talk to Years 5 & 6 (and who could deny him that answer?) came up to me at the end of the second session and said something that completely made all the effort worthwhile: He had an idea to combine some of the code from the previous week\u2019s project (attaching a sprite, with a couple of costumes, to the mouse pointer and changing costumes when clicked) with what he\u2019d built that afternoon to make the game even better. It was a super moment for me, as he\u2019d independently figured out a way to make the game better by \u201chacking\u201d it (and yes, this is \u201chacking\u201d in the proper sense, not the ignorant way the popular media use the word) \u2013 and using code from different sources.\n- **Scratch**: This may sound obvious, but embrace Scratch and the projects that CodeClub offer. Do them yourself, to get not only a better understanding and appreciation of Scratch itself, but also to get the project \u2013 its goals, purpose, challenges and flavours \u2013 into your head. It makes it a lot easier to lead the session this way. I was initially skeptical of Scratch, but the key point to remember about that skepticism is that it was formed before I used Scratch properly. I was completely wrong to be skeptical. It\u2019s an excellent learning environment \u2013 a design-time and run-time in one single executable, and a single interface too. It\u2019s got the right balance between syntax, graphics, ease-of-use and capabilities, and is absolutely ideal for teaching coding to primary school children. Yes, I would like to teach Python too, but Scratch is excellent in what it delivers.\n- **Collaboration**: The first project from CodeClub comes with a series of step-by-step instructions that you can use to lead the children through their first discovery of the Scratch environment. I used this in the first session, in fact I extended it into a complete discovery hour. It worked really well. I did something in Scratch \u2013 something small and bite-sized \u2013 and then the children followed suit and did the same thing themselves on their laptops or desktops. It got them used to the interface, but even more importantly, the side-effects of turning it into a Q&A were very valuable. \u201cHow might we do this?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you think would happen if we did that?\u201d and so on. The engagement factor was very high. So much so that for the next scheduled session, I\u2019ve prepared an \u201coff piste\u201d project that we\u2019ll do in collaborative mode, with me guiding them through a complete session to build a maths quiz game. And yes, for the ones running at a more rapid pace, I\u2019ve got some \u2018bonus\u2019 bits that we can cover separately.\n- **Employer**: Finally, some thoughts about how you might do this after school if you have a full time job. I\u2019m lucky in that my job involves programming and that I work for a forward thinking company \u2013 [Bluefin Solutions](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com). They already knew of my work with STEMnet, and of course being a company with the highest number of [SAP Mentors](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-23155), were already aware of the positive benefits of contributing back into communities. With a positive attitude towards social responsibility and an inherent interest in technology (a core competence) it was almost a no-brainer. Bluefin have supported me in my efforts thus far, and are being open minded and flexible (thanks folks!). I wrote a blog post on Bluefin\u2019s \u201cInsights\u201d section about CodeClub and related subjects: \u201c[Our Computational Future](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/insights\/blog\/our_computational_future\/)\u201c. If you can approach your employer and explain the benefits of CodeClub not only from a immediate payback view but also from a longer-term perspective you\u2019re in with a chance of succeeding. As an early bird, my working day starts well before most people\u2019s, so I manage to get things done to such a degree that switching to CodeClub on a Friday afternoon is workable. If you have flexible hours, then so much the better.\n\nOne final thought: If you\u2019re wondering whether to take the plunge and become a CodeClub volunteer, just go for it. The support is great, the community is growing, the time logistics will sort themselves out, and the rewards are unlimited. Go for it!\n\n\n","html":"<p>I&#8217;ve been a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeclub.org.uk\">CodeClub<\/a> leader for a while now at my local primary school, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.woodhouses.oldham.sch.uk\">Woodhouses Voluntary Controlled Primary School<\/a>, in Manchester. The club is after school on Friday afternoons and each session runs for an hour. We&#8217;re taking a break brought on by the Easter holidays, and I&#8217;m on holiday this week too, so I thought I&#8217;d put some thoughts together on how it&#8217;s gone so far.\u00a0Overall, it&#8217;s been a fantastic experience, if slightly chaotic and exhausting (in a good way) at times. The rewards of seeing enthusiasm and interest in the CodeClubbers, and above all their progress, have been great.<\/p>\n<p>After registering my interest as a volunteer last year, I didn&#8217;t get round to contacting a school until December, where I approached Woodhouses Primary, as it was in the village where I lived. I&#8217;d got my CRB check done back in September, via <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stemnet.org.uk\">STEMnet<\/a>, as advised by CodeClub, and that was a very straightforward process. In fact, I&#8217;m as much <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2012\/12\/codeclub-and-becoming-a-stem-ambassador\/\">involved as a STEMnet Ambassador<\/a> now as I am a CodeClub leader. Definitely worth looking into!<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeclub.org.uk\">CodeClub website<\/a> had some great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codeclub.org.uk\/start-a-club\/volunteers\">resources<\/a> to help build a case to put to a school, and good notes for volunteers on what to do, what to expect and even ideas on what to say (if you were unsure). I arranged a meeting with the Headteacher and Year 6&#8217;s Form teacher, and as soon as I explained what it was, how it worked, and that it was free, the deal was done. The following week I stood up in front of Year 5 and Year 6 children with <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1JvXiFUEf8oxHXwwKtnDBqOd3PhnDau5G_37fAlBQpQ0\/edit?usp=sharing\">some simple slides<\/a> and explained what programming was all about. At the end, when I asked who might be interested in becoming a member of an after-school CodeClub, there were a lot of raised hands!<\/p>\n<p>The school decided to restrict the availability to Year 6 children only, because of sheer numbers, and to give the Year 5 children something to look forward to! After all was said and done, I ended up with a total of 13 CodeClubbers.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some bite-sized thoughts on my experience so far.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hardware<\/strong>: I was somewhat (pleasantly) surprised that the school had enough laptops and desktops to go round. However, they were, understandably, in pretty poor shape, many suffering from performance issues, Windows update issues, and some would randomly refuse to boot.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Access<\/strong>: Further, each child had their own login, with restricted access. This meant that I had to get admin access to each of the machines to be able to install Scratch. This went well, generally, although some of the installs ended up with no icon on the child&#8217;s desktop, meaning we had to go and find the Scratch executable (c:Program Files&#8230;) to start it up in some cases.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Saving<\/strong>: children each had their own area (network-served home directory) to save files, so we use that to save their Scratch work each week. Access to the Web was possible, but via a proxy, the credentials to which have remained somewhat elusive, so we haven&#8217;t shared any projects on MIT&#8217;s Scratch community site yet. At least, not by direct upload from the Scratch environment (there are proxy and other config parameters you can set if you know the details).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Time<\/strong>: There were already a number of after school clubs active, but a Friday slot was free. This was ideal, as for me it meant I could choose that slot as the least likely time to impact my day job (more on that later) &#8211; I travel with work sometimes, but Friday is the day I&#8217;m most likely to be in Manchester. &#8220;After school&#8221; does not equate to &#8220;after work&#8221;, as the former starts usually around 15:15!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Setup<\/strong>: Some setup time each week is essential, to get the laptops out, arrange the desks and chairs, and get the worksheets ready (having a last look at the task in hand yourself, too!). So I try to arrive at 15:00 for a 15:15 CodeClub start. This also gives me time to think about what the key characteristics of the project are, so I can bind in some emphasis of those points during the session.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Materials<\/strong>: CodeClub has done a great job of putting materials together for the leaders. There are volunteers that put together projects on a term by term basis. Term 1 is Scratch-based, and what I&#8217;m teaching. For Term 1 there are three sets of three projects (i.e. 9 in total), and each project is about the size of a single CodeClub session. Some children finish sooner, others need more than a single session (this does get challenging sometimes, see later). There&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/codeclub-whackawitch.pdf\">sample project available on the CodeClub website<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Belonging<\/strong>: There are non-programming resources in the CodeClub materials &#8211; such as name badges, door signs and so on. These are wonderful, especially with the CodeClub branding, and I&#8217;ve used these to good effect to create a sense of club-style belonging. And as the CodeClub-supplied materials suggest, name badges are ideal for helping you remember each child&#8217;s name! A sense of belonging is heightened when you give children little tasks that they can own; I have a badge monitor (distributing and collecting them before and after each session), a door-sign monitor, and so on. And of course, getting them to start and end each session with an almighty &#8220;CodeClub&#8221; cry is as bonding as it is deafening!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ratio<\/strong>: CodeClub recommended around 10 children per volunteer. There&#8217;s only me at Woodhouses CodeClub so far, and I have 13. I would agree with CodeClub&#8217;s recommendation. While I&#8217;m just about coping, it does get a little hectic sometimes, as there are always plenty of questions, the children go at different paces, and it&#8217;s sometimes hard to get the balance right between spending quality time on an answer with one child and covering as many questions as possible in the shortest time. Overall, I&#8217;ve found that you soon get to recognise those that need more help generally, and those that are more independent. Bear that in mind, and above all, use praise a lot. It really boosts their confidence which in turn edges them further along the continuum from reliance towards independence.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Space<\/strong>: One thing that caught me completely by surprise was room logistics. The room we have at Woodhouses is long but narrow, and the way the desks and chairs are arranged (there&#8217;s only one way, really) means that when the children are in the chairs, it&#8217;s quite difficult sometimes for an adult-sized person to squeeze past. This becomes a real issue when you&#8217;re trying to flit between as many children as you can answering questions and helping out. If you can bear this in mind when arranging the table logistics, it will help you a lot more than you think.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Enthusiasm<\/strong>: Year 6 children are excitable and their enthusiasm shows itself in ways that we might initially think are disruptive and chaotic. With the graphical nature of Scratch, this chaos is extended into the projects themselves, with more or less every child wanting to use a different name, character or sprite costume for the project protagonists. Embrace it, don&#8217;t fight it. The only thing you should do is be consistent in the naming, so for example the two characters in the first project are a cat called Felix and a mouse called Herbert. What&#8217;s certain is that in many cases you&#8217;ll neither have cats or mice, nor the names Felix &amp; Herbert. But use &#8216;Felix&#8217; and &#8216;Herbert&#8217; consistently when you&#8217;re explaining things and the children will naturally translate into whatever they have.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Co-Working<\/strong>: Some children like to work together, others like to work alone. But for any emergency logistical reasons (laptop won&#8217;t boot) you can put them together and they won&#8217;t mind. Some children are also keen to help out, so embrace that and give them tasks (e.g. help the child next to them find the right sprite costume) and they will thank you for it.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Checkboxes<\/strong>: Each project worksheet has checkboxes that are designed to be checked off as each child completes that part (one worksheet per child). I forgot to specify that the children should come with pencils or pens on the first session, with the result that some of them, after an interruption, couldn&#8217;t find where they&#8217;d got to, and it took a little bit of time to work out where they were. So make sure they bring pencils to tick off each section as they do it. It helps them, but it also helps you when coming to answer a question.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Extras<\/strong>: Be prepared, or be ready to think on your feet. There&#8217;s a couple of girls that work together in our CodeClub, and they&#8217;re super keen and also very very competent. They just &#8220;get it&#8221; (e.g. I found myself explaining things to them with the use of the standard Scratch XY Coordinate stage background, possibly too advanced for some, and they loved it). They&#8217;re starting to consistently finish the projects before the end of the CodeClub session. There are great &#8216;bonus&#8217; tasks on the project handouts, which faster children can do, but I found myself having to give them completely new extra tasks to do to satisfy their hunger for learning and experimentation. So play around with Scratch yourself in between CodeClub sessions and you&#8217;ll be more readily able to come up with new small tasks at the drop of a hat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility<\/strong>: Be flexible and creative, too. I discovered that some of the desktop machines had faulty speakers, so the sounds that some of the characters were to make were no good. Rather than have the children disappointed, I encouraged them to &#8220;hack&#8221; the project by getting the characters to &#8220;say&#8221; or &#8220;think&#8221; (speech\/thought bubbles) something instead. They loved it, as they were doing something special.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Assets<\/strong>: One of the early Scratch projects involves image and sound asset files that are not part of the standard Scratch installation. They are, instead, supplied in the files made available for the CodeClub leaders. This is great, but one mistake I made was not loading the assets onto the laptops before the start of that project session, which meant that some time was wasted distributing them on a USB stick. So remember to check what the project requirements are before you start!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Coordination<\/strong>: The biggest challenge for me as the only volunteer (somewhat exacerbated by having 13 children) is that the varied pace of progress means that some children are finishing off the previous week&#8217;s project while others are starting the new one. This, combined with the room logistics, has been the toughest challenge for me. Keeping track of who is doing what, and therefore in what context to answer each question, is hard. What I want to avoid at all costs is for someone to get bored, either waiting for me to get round to answering their question, or because they&#8217;ve finished something and are waiting for new instruction. I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s an easy answer to this except perhaps to recruit a second volunteer (I&#8217;m in the process of doing that now!).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Certificates<\/strong>: One of the highlights for me has been the reward of Level 1 certificates for those children who&#8217;d managed to complete all three projects of Level 1 before Easter. Again, the CodeClub materials are fantastic and a nice A4 landscape certificate with the child&#8217;s name hand-written on it and handed out in assembly can only be a good thing, not only for the recipients, but for CodeClub and programming in general.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Highlights<\/strong>: As well as the specific highlights like certificate awards, there are many weekly highlights for me. Here&#8217;s just one example. A child, who&#8217;d enthusiastically suggested &#8220;Binary!&#8221; as a programming language in answer to one of my questions in the talk to Years 5 &amp; 6 (and who could deny him that answer?) came up to me at the end of the second session and said something that completely made all the effort worthwhile: He had an idea to combine some of the code from the previous week&#8217;s project (attaching a sprite, with a couple of costumes, to the mouse pointer and changing costumes when clicked) with what he&#8217;d built that afternoon to make the game even better. It was a super moment for me, as he&#8217;d independently figured out a way to make the game better by &#8220;hacking&#8221; it (and yes, this is &#8220;hacking&#8221; in the proper sense, not the ignorant way the popular media use the word) &#8211; and using code from different sources.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Scratch<\/strong>: This may sound obvious, but embrace Scratch and the projects that CodeClub offer. Do them yourself, to get not only a better understanding and appreciation of Scratch itself, but also to get the project &#8211; its goals, purpose, challenges and flavours &#8211; into your head. It makes it a lot easier to lead the session this way. I was initially skeptical of Scratch, but the key point to remember about that skepticism is that it was formed before I used Scratch properly. I was completely wrong to be skeptical. It&#8217;s an excellent learning environment &#8211; a design-time and run-time in one single executable, and a single interface too. It&#8217;s got the right balance between syntax, graphics, ease-of-use and capabilities, and is absolutely ideal for teaching coding to primary school children. Yes, I would like to teach Python too, but Scratch is excellent in what it delivers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration<\/strong>: The first project from CodeClub comes with a series of step-by-step instructions that you can use to lead the children through their first discovery of the Scratch environment.

I did something in Scratch &#8211; something small and bite-sized &#8211; and then the children followed suit and did the same thing themselves on their laptops or desktops. It got them used to the interface, but even more importantly, the side-effects of turning it into a Q&amp;A were very valuable. &#8220;How might we do this?&#8221;, &#8220;What do you think would happen if we did that?&#8221; and so on. The engagement factor was very high. So much so that for the next scheduled session, I&#8217;ve prepared an &#8220;off piste&#8221; project that we&#8217;ll do in collaborative mode, with me guiding them through a complete session to build a maths quiz game. And yes, for the ones running at a more rapid pace, I&#8217;ve got some &#8216;bonus&#8217; bits that we can cover separately.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Employer<\/strong>: Finally, some thoughts about how you might do this after school if you have a full time job.

It\u2019s not very sophisticated \u2013 all it does is\u00a0look through the Work calendar for all-day events matching a certain title pattern, then\u00a0look at the guest list; if the emails I want to share the event with are not already on the list, they\u2019re added, and invites are sent.\n\nBecause of [an issue with the CalendarService component of Google Apps Script](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-apps-script-issues\/issues\/detail?id=574) (that\u2019s been open since May 2011!) you can\u2019t directly cause invites to be sent to new guests that you add to an existing event. So one workaround is to create the calendar invitation (ICS file) yourself and email it. It\u2019s pretty simple (and Romain Vialard [has an example](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-apps-script-issues\/issues\/detail?id=574#c2) in the commentary on the issue).\n\nActually creating the ICS file myself was a solution to not one but two issues. The ICS files that are auto-generated by Google Calendar when you add a guest via the UI contain entries like this for all-day events:\n\nDTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20140305  \n DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20140306\n\nUnfortunately Outlook makes an incorrect guess as to the timezone for these dates, based on its own timezone, and when the recipient calendar is in a different timezone than the originating event (in my case UTC and UTC+1), it causes the replicated entry to be skewed by an hour, causing the all-day event to span the wrong days! So being in control of the ICS content generation means I can be more explicit which in turn means that Outlook doesn\u2019t get it wrong.\n\nDTSTART:20140305T000000Z  \n DTEND:20140306T000000Z\n\nSo that\u2019s it.

It&#8217;s not very sophisticated &#8211; all it does is\u00a0look through the Work calendar for all-day events matching a certain title pattern, then\u00a0look at the guest list; if the emails I want to share the event with are not already on the list, they&#8217;re added, and invites are sent.<\/p>\n<p>Because of <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-apps-script-issues\/issues\/detail?id=574\">an issue with the CalendarService component of Google Apps Script<\/a> (that&#8217;s been open since May 2011!) you can&#8217;t directly cause invites to be sent to new guests that you add to an existing event. So one workaround is to create the calendar invitation (ICS file) yourself and email it. It&#8217;s pretty simple (and Romain Vialard <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/google-apps-script-issues\/issues\/detail?id=574#c2\">has an example<\/a> in the commentary on the issue).<\/p>\n<p>Actually creating the ICS file myself was a solution to not one but two issues. The ICS files that are auto-generated by Google Calendar when you add a guest via the UI contain entries like this for all-day events:<\/p>\n<p>DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20140305<br \/>\nDTEND;VALUE=DATE:20140306<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately Outlook makes an incorrect guess as to the timezone for these dates, based on its own timezone, and when the recipient calendar is in a different timezone than the originating event (in my case UTC and UTC+1), it causes the replicated entry to be skewed by an hour, causing the all-day event to span the wrong days! So being in control of the ICS content generation means I can be more explicit which in turn means that Outlook doesn&#8217;t get it wrong.<\/p>\n<p>DTSTART:20140305T000000Z<br \/>\nDTEND:20140306T000000Z<\/p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/qmacro\/8219400\">I&#8217;ve made the script available as a Gist<\/a> on Github and here&#8217;s a screenshot of some typical results.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/log.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1564\" alt=\"log\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/log-300x120.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"120\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Share &amp; enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 13:55:34 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 13:58:03 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 02 Jan 2014 13:55:34 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1571,"title":"Alt-K: Reading Notes","slug":"alt-k-reading-notes","markdown":"\nWith my Kindle, and the [Send to Kindle Chrome extension](https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/send-to-kindle-for-google\/cgdjpilhipecahhcilnafpblkieebhea), I have a nice workflow for saving stuff (with a quick alt-k keypress) to read later.

While there, I chanced to meet some of the members of HERUG \u2013 the Higher Education & Research User Group. This is an interesting and well established group within the SAP ecosphere, and they have their own focus, goals and direction. But what makes them part of the ecosphere is their common interest in UX and this post captures that very well. The breadth of functional coverage for Fiori is huge.\n\n**[The Fiori Design Principles](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/people\/kai.richter\/blog\/2014\/06\/30\/the-fiori-design-principles) by Kai Richter.**  \n In my role as an SAP Mentor I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to attend and sometimes speak at some internal events, one of which was DKOM last year, where I saw Kai Richter speak. Kai is part of a large team of designers at SAP who are responsible for the UX that SAP Fiori brings. The members of the UI5 development and design teams are heroes of this new SAP era.

It was clear from the state and potential of the UI5 toolkit even back then that the HTML5-based outside-in UI paradigm at SAP was here to stay.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/ui-technology\/blog\/2014\/06\/28\/becoming-simple-takes-focus--now-fiori-personas-are-free--how-do-you-target-your-ux-efforts\">Becoming Simple takes focus &#8211; now Fiori and Personas are free &#8211; how do you target your UX efforts?<\/a>\u00a0by Jocelyn Dart.<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is a good in-depth piece which talks about UX, a subject relatively unknown in the SAP world until recently. There&#8217;s an interview with two folks in the SAP UX space, one coming from SAP&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/design-co-innovation.tumblr.com\/\">Design and Co-innovation<\/a> centre and information on SAP&#8217;s UX Advisory service, which is designed to help customers shape their design skills and strategy.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/higher-education-and-research\/blog\/2014\/06\/30\/fiori-changes-perception-of-campus-life\">Fiori Changes Perception of Campus Life!<\/a> by Rob Jonkers.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Earlier this year I flew to SAP Labs Palo Alto to attend a board meeting in my role as a member of the <a href=\"http:\/\/board.sapdevcenter.com\/\">SAP Developer Advisory Board<\/a>. While there, I chanced to meet some of the members of HERUG &#8211; the Higher Education &amp; Research User Group. This is an interesting and well established group within the SAP ecosphere, and they have their own focus, goals and direction. But what makes them part of the ecosphere is their common interest in UX and this post captures that very well. The breadth of functional coverage for Fiori is huge.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/people\/kai.richter\/blog\/2014\/06\/30\/the-fiori-design-principles\">The Fiori Design Principles<\/a> by Kai Richter.<\/strong><br \/>\nIn my role as an SAP Mentor I&#8217;m lucky enough to be able to attend and sometimes speak at some internal events, one of which was DKOM last year, where I saw Kai Richter speak. Kai is part of a large team of designers at SAP who are responsible for the UX that SAP Fiori brings. The members of the UI5 development and design teams are heroes of this new SAP era. This is a short article but captures nicely the principles and the essence of what Fiori means from a chief designer&#8217;s perspective.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;\">If you have any must-read Fiori articles, let me know!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 09:11:54 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 14:17:47 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 09:11:54 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1617,"title":"This Week in Fiori (2014-28)","slug":"this-week-in-fiori-2014-28","markdown":"\n[![SAP Fiori App Analysis tool](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/Screen-Shot-2014-07-09-at-07.26.411-300x255.png)](https:\/\/code.bluefinsolutions.com\/~dadams\/FioriWebinar\/AppAnalysis.html)Already a week has passed since my [first post in this series](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/07\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-27\/) and the Fiori related content is increasing.

It\u2019s a super conference on all things Open Source and I can heartily recommend it.\n\nBack in 2001, 2002 and 2003 I attended OSCON and spoke on the subject of SAP and Open Source. 2014 has come round and I\u2019m back, this time on the subject of [OpenUI5](http:\/\/openui5.org\/), the Open Sourced version of SAP\u2019s UI5 toolkit. Along with a couple of friends & SAP colleagues Andreas Kunz and Frederic Berg, we\u2019re giving a tutorial on the subject:\u00a0[Discover OpenUI5 \u2013 The New Web UI Library from SAP](http:\/\/www.oscon.com\/oscon2014\/public\/schedule\/detail\/35988),\u00a0as well as a presentation.\n\nSo I\u2019d like to start the week by giving a couple of pointers to background material (\u201cUI5 Credits\u201d and \u201cThe Essentials\u201d), to help you get a good idea of the Open Source software upon which UI5 is built. And of course, it\u2019s upon UI5 that SAP Fiori apps are built.\n\n**[UI5 Credits](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/#credits.html) by the UI5 team**  \n This part of the UI5 Software Development Kit (SDK) lists the libraries, toolkits and other software in the Open Source domain that are used to power parts of UI5.\n\n**[The Essentials: SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and Fiori](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/February-2014\/The-essentials-SAP-UI5-OpenUI5-and-Fiori\/) by me**  \n If you\u2019re interested in finding out more about the relationships between SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and Fiori, this short post should clear things up.\n\n**[Updated Version of SAP Fiori Client](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/mobile\/blog\/2014\/07\/13\/updated-version-of-the-sap-fiori-client-available) by John Wargo**  \n The SAP Fiori Client is a hybrid app for specific mobile devices (such as those running Android and iOS), designed specifically to run SAP Fiori apps. Built using Cordova (PhoneGap), it\u2019s a hybrid app in that it is an OS-native install, but is effectively a shell around a browser core, which then acts as the runtime SAP Fiori as usual.\n\nThe SAP Fiori Client was designed with performance in mind; amongst other things; for example, it caches the runtime to reduce startup costs. Since the initial release there\u2019s been an update, described in this post. The update contains bug fixes and relatively minor new functionality, but it\u2019s a good sign that maintenance is ongoing. The SAP Fiori Client is definitely worth a look.\n\n**[The SAP Fiori Fit: Part 1 \u2013 Your Fiori Strategy](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/mobile\/blog\/2014\/07\/16\/the-sap-fiori-fit-part-1--your-fiori-strategy) by Molly Maple**  \n This is a nicely balanced piece in the SAP Mobile section of the SAP Community Network site. It talks about what SAP Fiori is (a \u201cUX toolkit\u201d) and what it isn\u2019t (a \u201cmobile platform\u201d). It talks about the orthogonal styles of application delivery: Function-oriented (found in the traditional \u201cdynpro-style\u201d apps) and task-oriented (exemplified by the SAP Fiori apps themselves). And it covers some of the current benefits and shortcomings of Fiori when compared to the SAP Mobile Platform.\n\n**[HR Renewal & SAP Fiori Q&A Transcript](http:\/\/sapinsider.wispubs.com\/Assets\/Q-and-As\/2014\/July\/QA-with-Jeremy-Masters-on-HR-Renewal-Fiori-and-ESS-MSS) by Jeremy Masters**  \n SAPInsider ran a recent Q&A session focused on HR Renewal, Employee Self Service \/ Manager Self Service (ESS\/MSS) and SAP Fiori. Being a chat-based Q&A the questions and answers are all available. Folks asked about the ease of implementation, about the relationship with, and future demise of WebDynpro, and of course the Portal conundrum, made more interesting by the arrival of [SAP Fiori\u2019s Launchpad](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/February-2014\/The-essentials-SAP-UI5-OpenUI5-and-Fiori\/). Reading this Q&A gives you a good insight into what your peers are really thinking.\n\nOf course, I have to take some slight exception to one of Jeremy\u2019s answers regarding a reference to \u201cweb services\u201d and Gateway :-) \u00a0Yes, OData has the concept of a service document, and it\u2019s on the web (HTTP) but the specific phrase \u201cweb services\u201d conjures up something altogether more complex and heavyweight (and less RESTful).\n\nWell that just about wraps it up for this week. And while I\u2019m thousands of feet over the Atlantic, currently somewhere due south of Iceland, I wanted to leave you with an observation: It seems that each week, new companies and offerings are appearing in the SAP Fiori arena. Webinars (yep, we hosted a webinar on [Understanding SAP Fiori](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/July-2014\/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori\/) last month), demonstrations, Q&A sessions, fixed price implementation services and offers of free prototyping.\n\nThe best I saw this week was a statement from an SAP technology consulting company in the US, where the SAP Fiori practice lead claimed to have \u201cfive years plus of SAP Fiori focused delivery\u201d.

And I was reminded of that early this morning after seeing a [tweet and a screenshot from Tony de Thomasis showing SAP Fiori for TDMS 4.0](https:\/\/twitter.com\/c821311\/status\/495067577735864321\/photo\/1) \u2013 the scope of SAP Fiori apps is indeed widening further.

Do you find it useful? Let me know in the comments or via Twitter (I\u2019m [@qmacro](http:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro)).\n\n**the data is hand-gathered, see [The SAP Fiori App Analysis application](http:\/\/youtu.be\/aVeQ4asHgaY) for some background. Ideally SAP could make this data available and keep it up to date for us, right?\n\nAnyway, on to the picks for this week.\n\n**[OpenSAP\u2019s Introduction to SAP Fiori UX](https:\/\/open.sap.com\/course\/fiori1), by Prakalp Phadnis, Elizabeth Thorburn & Jamie Cawley**  \n Well, that didn\u2019t take long! SAP\u2019s extremely popular and successful Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) system \u201cOpenSAP\u201d is offering a free course on SAP Fiori. Specifically, Fiori User Experience (UX). After all, UX is at the heart of a lot of what the Fiori philosophy is about.\n\nI\u2019ve said in the past that Fiori is \u201cmany things, including a state of mind\u201d. I\u2019m hoping that this course, which promises lessons on fundamentals, latest features, installation, configuration and best practices for extensibility, will instill in the attendee a sense of what good looks like, and help to prevent possible dilution of the Fiori concepts.\n\n**[The SAP Fiori Launchpad has been added to the UX Explorer!](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/mobile\/blog\/2014\/07\/29\/the-sap-fiori-launchpad-has-been-added-to-the-ux-explorer) by Elizabeth Thorburn**  \n In [last week\u2019s TWIF installment](pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/07\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-30\/) I mentioned the functional proximities of the SAP Fiori Launchpad and the SAP Portal, in reference to a post by Aviad Rivlin. This week SAP have taken another step towards surfacing info about the important Launchpad, by including it in the UX Explorer.\n\nWith the [UX Explorer](https:\/\/uxexplorer.hana.ondemand.com\/index.html) you can find out about different User Interface (UI) and UX products and technologies from SAP. While the current content for the Launchpad isn\u2019t overwhelming, it is there, which is a start.

The SAP Co-Innovation labs are running a 3-day workshop for partners, covering design thinking, Fiori design principles, UI5 controls and more, culminating in the attendees building an app. It\u2019s not clear to me after reading the agenda and the description whether the app will be a mockup only (as detailed in the agenda) or complete and fully certified (as detailed in the description).

First, the material is very comprehensive and takes you from a very basic and raw application all the way through to a rather accomplished Fiori application, introducing many features of UI5 that are key to Fiori applications along the way. But also, it shows us that designing and building Fiori applications is not just in SAP\u2019s hands \u2013 it can be in *your* hands too.

But it\u2019s the fact that the design process has been gone through and also shared with the wider community that is interesting. In fact, if nothing else, use this as a pointer to the whole [SAP User Experience Community](https:\/\/experience.sap.com\/) site. And if you want to know more about charts in SAP Fiori, see [the chart section in the SAP Fiori Guidelines](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-guidelines\/FioriPatterns\/21_Fiori_Patterns-Charts.html).\n\n**[The UI5 Explored App](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/explored.html) by the UI5 Team**  \n The toolkit on which Fiori apps are built is UI5 (UI5 is the generic term I use for both the SAP licenced version SAPUI5 and the open source licenced version OpenUI5 \u2026 see [The Essentials \u2013 SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and Fiori](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/February-2014\/The-essentials-SAP-UI5-OpenUI5-and-Fiori\/) for more info). The UI5 [Software Development Kit](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/) (SDK) includes a large amount of documentation and example code, and part of that is known as the Explored App. It started out life specifically to showcase and provide example best practice approaches for controls in the responsive \u201csap.m\u201d library, but has graduated to being a top level menu section within the SDK and covers controls beyond \u201csap.m\u201d now too.\n\n(As with the CD168 tutorial materials, I am also proud to have had a hand in building the Explored App too ;-)\n\nWith the [Explored App](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/explored.html) you can, well, explore many features and functions within UI5, a good number of which are used to build Fiori applications, and you\u2019ll start to recognise component parts, building blocks that are used and reused to provide features such as search, lists, buttons, dialogs, and so on. Let\u2019s pick one \u2013 the [IconTabBar](http:\/\/localhost:8888\/sapui5\/latest\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.IconTabBar\/samples).

Another week has passed, and the writing of this week\u2019s TWIF should have found me in the Lake District, but alas due to circumstances too tedious to go into now, finds me about 90 miles south, back at home. Anyway, it\u2019s the end of the week and therefore time for some Fiori links and commentary. Let\u2019s get to them!\n\n**[SAP Fiori Launchpad for Developers](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-57363)\u00a0by Steffen Huester and Olivier Keimel**  \n In previous TWIF episodes I\u2019ve mentioned the SAP Fiori Launchpad and its importance to the Fiori app ecosphere. It\u2019s slowly becoming the new lightweight portal and rightly so. The SAP Fiori Launchpad has been designed to be cross platform (ABAP, HANA and Cloud stacks) and in true SAP style this design shows through in the form of abstraction layers \u2014 service adapters, the shell renderer and the application container. In fact, it\u2019s the application container that might pique your interest, as we see that it can not only host UI5 apps (via the Component concept) but also Web Dynpro ABAP and SAP GUI for HTML apps.\n\nThis document, which applies to the User Interface Add-On 1.0 SPS 05 (am I the only one to still refer to this product as \u201cUI2\u2033?) is a great resource which explains the Launchpad architecture and includes some details, and do\u2019s & don\u2019ts, on the [Component based approach](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/#docs\/guide\/170638b7a2b4424e8580fb473af6a3cd.html) to building and embedding apps. Yes, embedding \u2013 the Launchpad is a single HTML page (a resource with a URL typically ending \u201cFioriLaunchpad.html\u201d) into which UI5 apps, in the form of Components, are loaded.\n\nOne thing in this document that made me smile was a couple of references to the\u00a0[UI5 Application Best Practices guide](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/saphelp_hanaplatform\/helpdata\/en\/5c\/a68e6e62e6464a8103297fbc19cd9c\/content.htm?frameset=\/en\/d0\/1cd0b7be7f441cb6c56ad4577b428c\/frameset.htm&current_toc=\/en\/d0\/1cd0b7be7f441cb6c56ad4577b428c\/plain.htm&node_id=64)\u00a0(also\u00a0[available in the SDK docu](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/#docs\/guide\/5ca68e6e62e6464a8103297fbc19cd9c.html))\u00a0which is the work of my own hand :-)\n\n**[Build me an app that looks just like Fiori](www.insidesap.com.au\/in_depth\/build-me-an-app-that-looks-just-like-fiori-developing-mobile-apps-with-sapui5) by John Patterson  \n**This article only recently came to my attention. It was published a few days ago in Inside SAP but looking at some of the content towards the end (specifically about open sourcing), I think it was written a while ago.

Another week has passed, and the writing of this week&#8217;s TWIF should have found me in the Lake District, but alas due to circumstances too tedious to go into now, finds me about 90 miles south, back at home. Anyway, it&#8217;s the end of the week and therefore time for some Fiori links and commentary. Let&#8217;s get to them!<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-57363\">SAP Fiori Launchpad for Developers<\/a>\u00a0by Steffen Huester and Olivier Keimel<\/strong><br \/>\nIn previous TWIF episodes I&#8217;ve mentioned the SAP Fiori Launchpad and its importance to the Fiori app ecosphere. It&#8217;s slowly becoming the new lightweight portal and rightly so. The SAP Fiori Launchpad has been designed to be cross platform (ABAP, HANA and Cloud stacks) and in true SAP style this design shows through in the form of abstraction layers &#8212; service adapters, the shell renderer and the application container. In fact, it&#8217;s the application container that might pique your interest, as we see that it can not only host UI5 apps (via the Component concept) but also Web Dynpro ABAP and SAP GUI for HTML apps.<\/p>\n<p>This document, which applies to the User Interface Add-On 1.0 SPS 05 (am I the only one to still refer to this product as &#8220;UI2&#8243;?) is a great resource which explains the Launchpad architecture and includes some details, and do&#8217;s &amp; don&#8217;ts, on the <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/#docs\/guide\/170638b7a2b4424e8580fb473af6a3cd.html\">Component based approach<\/a> to building and embedding apps. Yes, embedding &#8211; the Launchpad is a single HTML page (a resource with a URL typically ending &#8220;FioriLaunchpad.html&#8221;) into which UI5 apps, in the form of Components, are loaded.<\/p>\n<p>One thing in this document that made me smile was a couple of references to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/help.sap.com\/saphelp_hanaplatform\/helpdata\/en\/5c\/a68e6e62e6464a8103297fbc19cd9c\/content.htm?frameset=\/en\/d0\/1cd0b7be7f441cb6c56ad4577b428c\/frameset.htm&amp;current_toc=\/en\/d0\/1cd0b7be7f441cb6c56ad4577b428c\/plain.htm&amp;node_id=64\">UI5 Application Best Practices guide<\/a>\u00a0(also\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/sdk\/#docs\/guide\/5ca68e6e62e6464a8103297fbc19cd9c.html\">available in the SDK docu<\/a>)\u00a0which is the work of my own hand :-)<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"www.insidesap.com.au\/in_depth\/build-me-an-app-that-looks-just-like-fiori-developing-mobile-apps-with-sapui5\">Build me an app that looks just like Fiori<\/a> by John Patterson<br \/>\n<\/strong>This article only recently came to my attention.

And just this morning there was a very interesting conversation on Twitter that I also want to bring to your attention; not only because it relates to Fiori, but also because it involves some of the key thinkers and doers in this space, folks that I respect greatly. So, let\u2019s get to it.\n\n**[Extensibility information for SAP Fiori](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/fiori_bs2013\/helpdata\/en\/c1\/804352b4e61b13e10000000a44176d\/frameset.htm) by SAP**  \n In my 27 years hacking on SAP, I\u2019ve seen the constant struggle between quality and quantity of SAP documentation. I cut my enterprise tech teeth on IBM mainframes \u2013 proprietary tech to the core, but my goodness did they have superb documentation, the quality and preciseness of which I\u2019ve never seen since, to be honest. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s had a love-hate relationship with SAP documentation, but having recently been on the other side of the fence (involved in [producing some documentation](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/saphelp_uiaddon10\/helpdata\/en\/5c\/a68e6e62e6464a8103297fbc19cd9c\/content.htm?frameset=\/en\/91\/f0ed206f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070\/frameset.htm) recently) I do know it\u2019s no easy task.\n\nSAP Fiori is here to stay, as are the underlying tech layers; and we need to be prepared to embrace a new SAP software logistics world that is very different from the old but comfortable ABAP stack based one with which we\u2019re familiar. Software logistics? Code management, version control, deployments, and extensions & enhancements \u2026 not least those modification free ones that allow us to survive service pack updates and the like.\n\nSo it is with this in mind that I reviewed what extensibility documentation exists in the SAP Fiori space. While it touches many of the bases, it is still relatively sparse on detail, and still lacking in examples. Still, it is a start, and I encourage you to read it, if nothing else, to discover the areas that you need to know more about \u2026 and persuade SAP to write more on.\n\n**[Fiori, Personas and beyond: selecting the best UI for SAP processes](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/ui-technology\/blog\/2014\/08\/13\/fiori-personas-and-beyond-selecting-the-best-ui-for-sap-processes) by Chris Scott**  \n This is a nicely considered post on the SAP Community Network that takes a step back from Fiori and encourages the reader to consider all the options for improving the overall user experience (UX). It highlights that there are options other than SAP Fiori of course, but more importantly it suggests, rightly, that the whole approach should be requirements driven, with a focus on improving process. Sure, this sounds obvious, but sometimes it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture when the tech is so compelling. It also goes some way to underline the basis of SAP Fiori UX strategy \u2013 task \/ function focused, according to role, rather than the more traditional feature-smorgasbord that we\u2019re used to in the UI that we drive by entering transaction codes.\n\n**[SAP Fiori Prototyping Kit](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-guidelines\/FioriDesign\/52_Fiori_Design-Prototyping-Kit.html) by SAP**  \n In [TWIF 2014-28](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/07\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-28\/), I highlighted the [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/wp-content\/fiori-guidelines\/). Bundled with these guidelines was a simple prototyping kit. The very fact that a prototyping kit exists suggests how important the user interface (UI) design process is if you want to produce good UX, and while there are different philosophies related to prototyping, a lowest-common-denominator approach is to mock stuff up with building blocks that represent UI component parts. The prototyping kit has these component parts, and has recently (this month) been updated. Definitely worth a download.\n\nA useful side effect of tools like this is that we stand a better chance of producing appropriate and consistent, compatible \u201cFiori-like\u201d UIs that don\u2019t jar when switching from one app to the next.\n\n**[On UI5 and Fiori deployment and extensions](https:\/\/twitter.com\/grahamrobbo\/status\/503123365671219200) by The Usual Suspects on Twitter**  \n A very interesting conversation came about on Twitter this morning, with UI5 and Fiori luminaries such as [Graham Robinson](http:\/\/twitter.com\/grahamrobbo), [John Patterson](http:\/\/twitter.com\/jasper_07) and [Jason Scott](http:\/\/twitter.com\/js1972).

My take on the conversation, and the thoughts in the minds of the participants, was that we need to keep a close eye on where SAP is going with tooling, and where we as individual developers want to go, how the paths are similar and how they\u2019re different.

Bad UX at its best.*\n\n**[Use Cases for Extending the UI of SAP Fiori Apps](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-52555) by Clement Selvaraj  \n**One of the better (read: more comprehensive) PDF based documents to come out over the past few months, that has only just come to my attention, is this PDF-based detailed document on extending SAP Fiori apps. It takes a specific functional scenario ([Report Quality Issue](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/fiori_bs2013\/helpdata\/en\/20\/c74c522565d330e10000000a44538d\/frameset.htm)) and walks the reader through a series of extension use cases. These use cases cover the extension concepts (extension points and controller hooks), and as a nice by-product, give the reader insight into a little bit of how a real SAP Fiori app is put together under the covers. For example, it highlights the Sn views (S2.view.xml, S3.view.xml, and so on) which my colleague Brenton and I covered in our [Understanding SAP Fiori Webinar](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/July-2014\/Webinar-more-Understanding-SAP-Fiori\/)\u00a0a couple of months ago. See the accompanying video screencast \u201c[Understanding SAP Fiori](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nM0ffI-GxGk)\u201d for more details.\n\nWell that\u2019s it for now, thanks for reading.

We took a Fiori design led approach with the exercises and I would say that by the end of the day all the attendees had gained a good appreciation for UI5 and a decent understanding of the development approach.

SAP Fiori, part of SAP\u2019s \u201cNew, Renew, Enable\u201d strategy*, specifically the \u201cRenew\u201d part, is not going to cover the entire functional breadth of, say, your ECC system.

But this short screencast is a nice reminder of what\u2019s possible. The ability to track activity on a user basis, even on a page basis, is extremely valuable. Combine the detail that Google Analytics gives you, with the ability to explicitly send details on page views from your Fiori app (on a certain event in UI5, such as a navigation) and use that information for the next iteration of your app, focusing on roles and task-based activities, and you can build yourself\u00a0a nice UX feedback loop.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s a nice example of sending explicit events to Google Analytics on Joseph Adams\u2019s post \u201c[Optimizing page timings for Google Analytics](http:\/\/jcla1.com\/blog\/optimizing-google-analytics\/)\u201c.\n\n**[The Power of Design Thinking in Fiori Application Development](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/mobile\/blog\/2014\/09\/19\/the-power-of-design-thinking-in-fiori-application-development) by Sarah Lottman**  \n This is a good short piece on, well, basically, talking to the user to work out what they need. I\u2019m still not sure what design thinking is, over and above putting yourself in the users shoes and working out what they want, before developing stuff. Of course, this is very glib of me and I may have missed the mark, and the design process that Sarah describes is neither easy nor obvious. I myself am guilty of building software and then imposing that upon others, without having talked to them.\n\nSo perhaps the key takeaway is actually that one way to get design right is to use the building blocks that Sarah describes \u2013 persona creation, process and task flow mapping, and wireframing. Actually it\u2019s often fun to skip wireframing and jump straight to throwing UI5 control declarations into an XML view structure and throwing it at the screen.

That time has come around again to pull together a few links on some of the Fiori related stories and articles this week. Let\u2019s get right to it.\n\n**[Transactional Fiori App Certification](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-57831) by Chiranjivi R D**  \n****I touched on certification of Fiori apps in an earlier TWIF episode [2014-31](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/08\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-31\/) where I pointed to a Partner Co-Innovation Workshop that mentioned certification of Fiori apps developed therein. Certification, at least to me, is not automatically a good thing. I\u2019m strongly ambivalent (if that\u2019s possible) on certification generally, of consultants specifically, and of apps particularly.\n\nThis week, this article on Fiori app certification was brought to my attention by friend and fellow SAP Mentor [Tobias Trapp](http:\/\/twitter.com\/ttrapp). It\u2019s all about the certification of transactional Fiori apps built by partners. With Fiori, there\u2019s great emphasis on the UX principles, and rightly so. There are also of course also the Gateway and Business Suite add-ons too, but for me the primary goal for certification in this area must be how the Fiori app works from a user experience point of view. My general certification ambivalence is then given a run for its money here; I for one do think that without some kind of standards enforcement, the Fiori approach may be diluted. I\u2019ve seen apps that are purportedly \u201cFiori\u201d but just don\u2019t feel right.\n\nOnly time will tell. What is your experience of custom Fiori apps? Have you seen Fiori apps that, well, aren\u2019t?\n\n**[User Experience Sessions at TechEd: SAP Screen Personas, Fiori, UX Strategy, Design Services](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/gui\/blog\/2014\/09\/25\/user-experience-sessions-at-teched-sap-screen-personas-fiori-ux-strategy-design-services) by Peter Spielvogel**  \n[SAP TechEd && d-code](http:\/\/www.sapdcode.com\/), arguably the most important event in SAP\u2019s annual calendar, is fast approaching. Already, the Las Vegas edition \u2026 which I like to call the \u201cwarm up before the main European event\u201d :-) \u2026 is less than a month away.

For example, this week\u2019s lectures entail the long winded description of configuration (especially in the area of role assignments in PFCG), only backed up by static slides. Unless I missed it, I didn\u2019t see any actual real live screencasts of configuration in action.

That time has come around again to pull together a few links on some of the Fiori related stories and articles this week.

Certification, at least to me, is not automatically a good thing. I&#8217;m strongly ambivalent (if that&#8217;s possible) on certification generally, of consultants specifically, and of apps particularly.<\/p>\n<p>This week, this article on Fiori app certification was brought to my attention by friend and fellow SAP Mentor <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ttrapp\">Tobias Trapp<\/a>. It&#8217;s all about the certification of transactional Fiori apps built by partners. With Fiori, there&#8217;s great emphasis on the UX principles, and rightly so. There are also of course also the Gateway and Business Suite add-ons too, but for me the primary goal for certification in this area must be how the Fiori app works from a user experience point of view. My general certification ambivalence is then given a run for its money here; I for one do think that without some kind of standards enforcement, the Fiori approach may be diluted. I&#8217;ve seen apps that are purportedly &#8220;Fiori&#8221; but just don&#8217;t feel right.<\/p>\n<p>Only time will tell. What is your experience of custom Fiori apps?

Although only a short post, it\u2019s worth mentioning\u00a0here, because it helps crystallise SAP\u2019s intentions in this space (readers of this TWIF series have seen many mentions of this subject in the past) and also because it points to a whitepaper \u201c[SAP Enterprise Portal and SAP Fiori \u2013 Common Architecture Recommendations](https:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-58843)\u201d which is worth a read.\n\n**[What\u2019s New in SAP Fiori Launchpad](http:\/\/help.sap.com\/saphelp_uiaddon10\/helpdata\/en\/5d\/bad3ee1b78427c98eb9fe68999b9a4\/frameset.htm) by SAP**  \n For the\u00a0UI Add-On for NetWeaver, otherwise known as UI2,\u00a0version 1.0 SPS 10 is now available. This is a layer of software that provides a lot of the Fiori services and infrastructure (yes, [there\u2019s more to Fiori than just UX](https:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/523472656457531392), you know ;-) including the UI5 runtime, the personalisation services and the Launchpad. While the individual Fiori apps are of course the main event, without this layer, without the Launchpad, the experience would be\u00a0lacking something.\n\nThis What\u2019s New document, in the UI2 section of help.sap.com, gives us a good overview on what have been the important areas of focus for SAP in the recent period. Notably, these areas are for Portal integration (the headerless mode) and performance. With performance, there have been various improvements, from moving the storage of personalisation information from an XML document to database tables (who thought using XML documents for storage of large amounts of data was a good idea?) to cacheing of target mappings in the browser.

An online, available, demo version of SAP Fiori. For folks to get a better feel for the Launchpad, for some of the apps, and to experience the UX first hand. Not only will this be great for all of that, but for those implementing their own Fiori apps, it will also serve as useful and hopefully always-available reference designs, alongside the SAP Fiori Design Guidelines I wrote about in [TWIF episode 2014-28](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/07\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-28\/).\n\nWhy not ideal? Well, it only contains a very small number of apps from the 300+ available, and the sample data is a little flat. Here are the apps available:\n\n- ERP HCM - Approve Timesheets\n- Approve Leave Requests\n- My Benefits\n- My Leave Requests\n- My Paystubs\n- My Timesheet\n- ERP SD (Logistics) - Change Sales Orders\n- Check Price and Availability\n- Change Sales Orders\n- Track Sales Orders\n- ERP Accounting - My Spend\n- Customer Invoices\n- ERP Logistics (MM) - Approve Purchase Contracts\n- Approve Purchase Orders\n- Approve Requisitions\n- Order From Requisitions\n\nIt\u2019s early days for this demo, and I\u2019m hoping to see a lot wider variety of apps available, along with more meaningful sample business data, in the next iteration.

For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I work in the Fiori and User experience space with DJ and I am a fellow SAPUI5\/OpenUI5 advocate for a long time now. I focus more on the mobility side of things more than anything else but for me it\u2019s all about bringing amazing solutions to end users and having a bit of fun while doing it :-)\n\nSo this week of course was the beginning of what I call TechEd season or now I suppose we have to call it d-code season. Last week saw SAP TechEd and d-code take place in the wonderful Venetian resort in Las Vegas. Now that I am starting to get over my jet lag, DJ asked me to jot down a few of the highlights for this\u00a0edition of\u00a0\u201cThis Week in Fiori\u201d.\n\n**[SAP Executive Keynote from SAP TechEd & D-code](http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13492) by Steve Lucas  \n**The first mention has to go, of course, to the keynote with Steve Lucas. With a relaxed and developer focused atmosphere it was an incredibly enjoyable 75 minutes covering some of the amazing things that people are doing with SAP software. The reason it gets a special mention here is because it was (for me anyway) the first time I saw SAP Fiori on a watch. Steve introduces\u00a0a real-time Fiori application on the HANA cloud platform which was\u00a0integrated with and primarily used on Samsung\u2019s latest smart watches. The demo is at about 59+ minutes for anybody interested. In fact, the entire keynote is well worth the time as it really brought to life some of SAP\u2019s new technologies.\n\n[**SAP Fiori Launchpad Overview**](http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13578)**by Aviad Rivlin  \n**Aviad does it again with this excellent overview of the SAP Fiori Launchpad in this voice-over session. Talking us through the Launchpad itself, it\u2019s capabilities as well as an overview of how the launchpad could work in a Hybrid scenario where some functionality is based on-premise and some based in the cloud. Well worth a watch for anybody interested or working with the Launchpad.\n\n**[Unified Inbox with SAP Fiori](http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13558) by\u00a0Ramana Mohanbabu  \n**This was quite an interesting session I enjoyed covering the connection of the SAP Fiori Unified inbox to multiple systems to give an end user access to all of their SBWP items in a much more usable way.\n\n**[Swell Analytics](http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13682) by Clint Vosloo and\u00a0Chris Rae  \n**Although competing directly with myself and John Appleby during this years DemoJam I am always more than happy to give credit where it is most definitely due and these guys deserve it! They created an amazing application using OpenUI5 to identify, predict and rate the quality of swells for surfers (yes I said surfers!). Well worth a watch and shows off the awesome stuff you can build with OpenUI5.\n\nThese are just 4 of the very many Fiori and OpenUI5 related sessions\u00a0from Las Vegas that caught my eye. If I was to mention all of the sessions, you would get bored far quicker than I can type so I won\u2019t even try. But please do check out the rest of the sessions covering all SAP\u2019s new offerings from the HANA Cloud Platform (HCP), SAP Mobile Secure right through to the easy way developers can try all this out for themselves at\u00a0[hcp.sap.com](http:\/\/hcp.sap.com\/).\n\nSo all that is left for me to do is thank DJ for allowing me to post on some of my experiences from Las Vegas.

Well worth a watch for anybody interested or working with the Launchpad.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13558\" target=\"_blank\">Unified Inbox with SAP Fiori<\/a> by\u00a0Ramana Mohanbabu<br \/>\n<\/strong>This was quite an interesting session I enjoyed covering the connection of the SAP Fiori Unified inbox to multiple systems to give an end user access to all of their SBWP items in a much more usable way.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/events.sap.com\/teched\/en\/session\/13682\" target=\"_blank\">Swell Analytics<\/a> by Clint Vosloo and\u00a0Chris Rae<br \/>\n<\/strong>Although competing directly with myself and John Appleby during this years DemoJam I am always more than happy to give credit where it is most definitely due and these guys deserve it! They created an amazing application using OpenUI5 to identify, predict and rate the quality of swells for surfers (yes I said surfers!). Well worth a watch and shows off the awesome stuff you can build with OpenUI5.<\/p>\n<p>These are just 4 of the very many Fiori and OpenUI5 related sessions\u00a0from Las Vegas that caught my eye. If I was to mention all of the sessions, you would get bored far quicker than I can type so I won&#8217;t even try.

It was a fantastic event, mainly due to the people and the content, but also because it hit a sweet spot between different types of SAP developer events.\n\nThe summit was the first of its kind to be organised by SAP, and judging from the feedback from the attendees there and then, combined with my own experience, it was a huge success. It was held over a two day period in the centre of a hotbed of SAP architect and developer talent, with folks converging on the wonderful Australian Technology Park in Sydney from all over the region, plus various additions from the UK, USA and elsewhere.\n\nThe Australian Technology Park was almost the perfect setting, being based on a centre of technology (heavy transport and industry) from the last millenium, a centre that proudly displayed historical, and some still-working physical artifacts, reminding me a lot of the [Museum of Science & Industry](http:\/\/www.mosi.org.uk\/) back home in Manchester.\n\n\n# The Summit\n\nFalling directly after SAP TechEd Berlin, firmly within the SAP tech conference season, the summit attracted over 300 attendees. There were a number of reasons for this being a great event to attend \u2013 the style was a sweet-spot between different sized events, it was priced well, and the content was just right.\n\n\n## **Sweet Spot**\n\nThere\u2019s the daddy of all SAP conferences, SAP TechEd && d-code, and then at the other end of the scale there are grass roots community-organised types such as CodeJams and InsideTracks. While the former extends, with the InnoJam pre-event, to more or less a week, and the latter often being single-day affairs, this summit hit the sweet spot in between, finding a great balance between time and content.\n\n\n## **Price Point**\n\nThis was one of those unusual events where the travel and accommodation costs, even for those relatively local, were more than the event itself. (Because I was speaking, SAP covered my costs \u2013 thank you!). This is significant; a price point of AUD 695.00 (around GBP 385.00) combined with the agenda means that it was hard to resist.\n\n\n## **People & Content**\n\nThe two most important ingredients of course for any event are the people and the content, often going together. Here are just a few of the hands-on workshop items from the [agenda](http:\/\/eventscontent.sapvirtualevents.com\/content\/dam\/sapvep\/customimages\/au-sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/SAP_Architect_and_Developer_Summit_Brochure_v2.pdf):\n\n- Developing SAP HANA Native Applications with SAP HANA Cloud Platform (Thomas Jung)\n- Designing SAP Fiori Custom Applications (Kynan Jones & John Patterson)\n- SQLScript \u2013 Push Code Down into SAP HANA to Achieve Maximum Performance (Rich Heilmann)\n- Advanced OData Service Development with SAP Gateway (Mustafa Saglam)\n- Build SAP HANA Cloud Applications which Integrate with On-Premise Systems (Chris Paine)\n\nWith those sessions typical of the quality and content, given by those people, you know it\u2019s going to turn out well.\n\nJust as significant as the agenda were the conversations to be had with the amazing folk that were there too. Trying to name them all would be an exercise in futility; suffice it to say that the large majority of what I\u2019m going to call the \u201cANZ SAP Mob\u201d (in reference to the \u201cDutch SAP Mafia\u201d) were there, which for me was reason enough to attend. To be able to learn from conversations with these people was priceless.\n\n\n# My Contribution\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to contribute in three ways to this summit.\n\n\n## **Locknote**\n\nI gave a keynote at the end of Day 1 (called a \u201clocknote\u201d \u2013 who knew?) entitled \u201c[Fiori and UI5 Software Logistics, or: Are We in the Future Yet?](http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2014\/sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/sdfyrd\/)\u201c.\n\nMy aim was to convey the idea that in the SAP development world, we\u2019ve been heretofore shielded from and largely unaware of one of the most important parts of software development \u2013 the artifacts.\n\nYou could perhaps think of artifacts as the tangible results of our mental machinations, a developer currency that we grow, discuss, exchange and share. And with the advent of Fiori and UI5 development, we should think explicitly about how we should nurture these artifacts to be the best we can make them, and in doing that, embrace tools available outside the traditional SAP developer ecosphere. Tools such as linters, editors, workflow mechanisms and source code control systems. In particular, I focused on git and [Github Workflow](https:\/\/guides.github.com\/introduction\/flow\/index.html).\n\n\n## **Workshop**\n\nOn Day 2 I held a 2 hour hands-on workshop entitled \u201c[Learn to Drive Fiori Applications from Underneath and Level Up!](http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2014\/sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/sdfyrf\/)\u201c.\n\n[![Workshop booklet screenshot](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-13.40.21-207x300.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-13.40.21.png)\n\nIn this workshop I took the attendees (the workshop was fully booked!) through a Fiori application, from underneath, discovering it, controlling it, driving it and modifying it via the Chrome Developer Tools. There was a lot of content to get through but we managed it, not least due to the fact that everyone got on board with the approach and really did a great job in collaborating and keeping up with me. Thanks folks!\n\nWhen I was preparing the workshop booklet, it took on a life of its own, so much so that it turned into a standalone 48-page mini-publication so that anyone who had it could follow through everything I wanted to teach, even after the workshop. And I\u2019m making that workshop booklet available to everyone so that they can all benefit:\n\n[Workshop Booklet: Learn to Drive Fiori Applications from Underneath and Level Up!](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ldfaulu)\n\nIf you would like to leave any feedback please go ahead and do that at the end of this post.\n\n\n## **Executive Lunch**\n\nOn Day 1 there was an Executive Lunch event with folks from all around the Australia and NZ region. I spoke on the new development paradigm that Fiori and UI5 has ushered into the SAP developer world, and gave an impromptu demonstration on UI5 development, building a simple app as they ate their lunch :-)\n\n\n# The Future\n\nI hear that SAP ANZ are planning to run this event again next year, which is great. The aim is to attract more attendees, which is also great. But there\u2019s also a balance to be maintained; the synergy, the timing of two full days, the ability to talk to everyone, was, in my opinion, just right.\n\nI\u2019m really hoping that this event has a future, stays roughly true to this inaugural incarnation, and spreads to other areas around the globe. If one came to Europe, I\u2019d sign up immediately and encourage my fellow SAP hackers to do the same.\n\nWell done to all the team for organising this, and thanks to all the superheroes that attended and shared knowledge and experience. We are architects and developers. Learning from one another and sharing with one another is what we do.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><em>Update: This has also been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/November-2014\/The-Inaugural-SAP-Architect-Developer-Summit\/\">published on the Bluefin Solutions website<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was honoured to <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/10\/speaking-at-the-sap-architect-developer-summit\/\">have been invited<\/a> to speak at the inaugural <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/anzsummit\">SAP Architect &amp; Developer Summit<\/a> which happened last\u00a0week (20-21 Nov 2014) in Sydney.

Here are just a few of the hands-on workshop items from the <a href=\"http:\/\/eventscontent.sapvirtualevents.com\/content\/dam\/sapvep\/customimages\/au-sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/SAP_Architect_and_Developer_Summit_Brochure_v2.pdf\">agenda<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing SAP HANA Native Applications with SAP HANA Cloud Platform (Thomas Jung)<\/li>\n<li>Designing SAP Fiori Custom Applications (Kynan Jones &amp; John Patterson)<\/li>\n<li>SQLScript \u2013 Push Code Down into SAP HANA to Achieve Maximum Performance (Rich Heilmann)<\/li>\n<li>Advanced OData Service Development with SAP Gateway (Mustafa Saglam)<\/li>\n<li>Build SAP HANA Cloud Applications which Integrate with On-Premise Systems (Chris Paine)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With those sessions typical of the quality and content, given by those people, you know it&#8217;s going to turn out well.<\/p>\n<p>Just as significant as the agenda were the conversations to be had with the amazing folk that were there too. Trying to name them all would be an exercise in futility; suffice it to say that the large majority of what I&#8217;m going to call the &#8220;ANZ SAP Mob&#8221; (in reference to the &#8220;Dutch SAP Mafia&#8221;) were there, which for me was reason enough to attend. To be able to learn from conversations with these people was priceless.<\/p>\n<h1>My Contribution<\/h1>\n<p>I was lucky enough to be able to contribute in three ways to this summit.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Locknote<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>I gave a keynote at the end of Day 1 (called a &#8220;locknote&#8221; &#8211; who knew?) entitled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2014\/sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/sdfyrd\/\">Fiori and UI5 Software Logistics, or: Are We in the Future Yet?<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>My aim was to convey the idea that in the SAP development world, we&#8217;ve been heretofore shielded from and largely unaware of one of the most important parts of software development &#8211; the artifacts.<\/p>\n<p>You could perhaps think of artifacts as the tangible results of our mental machinations, a developer currency that we grow, discuss, exchange and share. And with the advent of Fiori and UI5 development, we should think explicitly about how we should nurture these artifacts to be the best we can make them, and in doing that, embrace tools available outside the traditional SAP developer ecosphere. Tools such as linters, editors, workflow mechanisms and source code control systems. In particular, I focused on git and <a href=\"https:\/\/guides.github.com\/introduction\/flow\/index.html\">Github Workflow<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Workshop<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>On Day 2 I held a 2 hour hands-on workshop entitled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2014\/sap-architect-and-developer-summit\/sdfyrf\/\">Learn to Drive Fiori Applications from Underneath and Level Up!<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-13.40.21.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-1814 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-27-at-13.40.21-207x300.png\" alt=\"Workshop booklet screenshot\" width=\"207\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In this workshop I took the attendees (the workshop was fully booked!) through a Fiori application, from underneath, discovering it, controlling it, driving it and modifying it via the Chrome Developer Tools. There was a lot of content to get through but we managed it, not least due to the fact that everyone got on board with the approach and really did a great job in collaborating and keeping up with me. Thanks folks!<\/p>\n<p>When I was preparing the workshop booklet, it took on a life of its own, so much so that it turned into a standalone 48-page mini-publication so that anyone who had it could follow through everything I wanted to teach, even after the workshop. And I&#8217;m making that workshop booklet available to everyone so that they can all benefit:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/ldfaulu\">Workshop Booklet: Learn to Drive Fiori Applications from Underneath and Level Up!<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you would like to leave any feedback please go ahead and do that at the end of this post.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Executive Lunch<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>On Day 1 there was an Executive Lunch event with folks from all around the Australia and NZ region. I spoke on the new development paradigm that Fiori and UI5 has ushered into the SAP developer world, and gave an impromptu demonstration on UI5 development, building a simple app as they ate their lunch :-)<\/p>\n<h1>The Future<\/h1>\n<p>I hear that SAP ANZ are planning to run this event again next year, which is great. The aim is to attract more attendees, which is also great. But there&#8217;s also a balance to be maintained; the synergy, the timing of two full days, the ability to talk to everyone, was, in my opinion, just right.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really hoping that this event has a future, stays roughly true to this inaugural incarnation, and spreads to other areas around the globe. If one came to Europe, I&#8217;d sign up immediately and encourage my fellow SAP hackers to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Well done to all the team for organising this, and thanks to all the superheroes that attended and shared knowledge and experience. We are architects and developers. Learning from one another and sharing with one another is what we do.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 06:56:19 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 05 Dec 2014 10:21:08 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 06:56:19 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":1820,"title":"DNA is still in our DNA","slug":"dna-is-still-in-our-dna","markdown":"\nVia [a tweet that was retweeted by Ben Nuttall](https:\/\/twitter.com\/aidanfeldman\/status\/551091071749353472), I came across\u00a0a\u00a0recent article in the Independent \u201c[Microsoft to replace Internet Explorer with new, streamlined browser](http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/gadgets-and-tech\/news\/microsoft-to-replace-internet-explorer-with-new-streamlined-browser-9949448.html)\u201c.

This post is a random collection of thoughts about the running, the data and some simple analysis, in Clojure.\n\n\n# Watches\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_1825\" style=\"width: 160px\">[![Garmin Forerunner 110](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/garmin110-150x150.jpeg)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/garmin110.jpeg)Garmin Forerunner 110\n\n<\/div>I\u2019ve been using a [Garmin Forerunner 110](https:\/\/buy.garmin.com\/en-GB\/GB\/watches-wearable-technology\/wearables\/forerunner-110\/prod63511.html) watch which has been very good, on the whole, although the USB cable and connectivity left something to be desired.\n\nI bought my wife Michelle a [TomTom Runner Cardio](http:\/\/www.tomtom.com\/en_gb\/sports\/running\/products\/runner-cardio-gps-watch\/white-red\/) for her birthday back in August, and have been intrigued by it ever since. And she bought me one for Christmas, so I\u2019m trying that out for 2015. I went out on my first run of this year with it [just this morning](https:\/\/twitter.com\/qmacro\/status\/551299062616817664), in fact.\n\n\n# Run data\n\nBut back to 2014. I completed 101 runs\u00a0(1,281.22km) and they\u2019re all logged in Endomondo. I don\u2019t have the premium subscription, just the basic, but the features are pretty good. There\u2019s an option to upload from the Garmin watch, via a browser plugin which (on this OSX machine) has become pretty flakey recently and now only works in Safari, but once uploaded, the stats for each run are shown rather nicely:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1826\" style=\"width: 551px\">[![A run on Endomondo](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-10.16.43-1024x811.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-10.16.43.png)A run on Endomondo\n\n<\/div>Endomondo also offers simple statistics and charts, and a tabular overview of the runs, that looks like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1827\" style=\"width: 541px\">[![Tabular view of runs in Endomondo](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-10.19.25-1024x368.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-10.19.25.png)Tabular view of runs in Endomondo\n\n<\/div>One thing that bothered me, at least with the free service, is that there was no option to download this data. So I paged through the tabular data, and copy\/pasted the information into a Google Sheet, my favourite gathering-and-stepping-off point for a lot of my data munging.\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1829\" style=\"width: 534px\">[![Running history in a Google Sheet](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.31.28.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.31.28.png)Running history in a Google Sheet\n\n<\/div>If nothing else, as long as the data is largely two dimensional, I\u2019ve found it\u2019s a good way to visually inspect the data at 10000 feet. It also affords the opportunity for some charting action, so I had a look at my pace over the year, to see how it had improved. This is the result:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1830\" style=\"width: 540px\">[![Pace improvement in 2014](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.33.37-1024x519.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.33.37.png)Pace improvement in 2014\n\n<\/div>The three\u00a0peaks in Feb, Jun and Sep are a couple of initial runs I did with Michelle plus her first 8km in London (now she\u2019s in double km figures and has a decent pace, I\u2019m very proud of her).\n\n\n# Some Analysis in Clojure\n\nI could have gone further with the analysis in the spreadsheet itself, but I\u2019m also just starting to try and\u00a0teach myself\u00a0[Clojure](http:\/\/clojure.org\/),\u00a0and thought this would be a nice little opportunity for a bit of data retrieval and analysis.\n\n\n## Exposing the data\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption alignright\" id=\"attachment_1831\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![Start of the JSON representation of the run data](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.41.19-300x219.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-11.41.19.png)Start of the JSON representation of the run data\n\n<\/div>Of course, the first thing to do was to make the data in the Google Sheet available, which I did with my trusty [SheetAsJSON](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2013\/10\/sheetasjson-google-spreadsheet-data-as-json\/) mechanism. It [returned](http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014) a nice JSON structure that contained all the data that I needed.\n\nSo now I had something that I could get Clojure to retrieve. Here follows\u00a0some\u00a0of what I did.\n\n\n## Creating the project\n\nI\u2019m using [Leiningen](http:\/\/leiningen.org\/), which is amazing in a combined couple of ways: it Just Works(tm), and it uses Maven. \u00a0My only previous experience of Maven had me concluding that Maven was an absolute nightmare, but Leiningen has completely changed my mind. Although I don\u2019t actually have to think about Maven at all, Leiningen does it all for me, and my hair is not on fire (for those of you wondering, Leiningen\u2019s tagline is \u201cfor automating\u00a0Clojure projects without setting your hair on fire\u201d, which I like).\n\nSo I used Leiningen to create a new application project:\n\nlein new app running-stats\n\nand used my joint-favourite editor (Vim, obviously, along with Atom), with some super Clojure-related plugins such as [vim-fireplace,](https:\/\/github.com\/tpope\/vim-fireplace) to edit the core.clj file. (more on my Vim plugins\u00a0another time).\n\nHere\u2019s a short exerpt from what I wrote:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-01-03 at 12.51.47](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-12.51.47.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-03-at-12.51.47.png)\n\nLet\u2019s look at this code step by step.\n\n\n## Library use\n\nI\u2019m using Clojure\u2019s [data.json](https:\/\/github.com\/clojure\/data.json) library (line 2) to be able to parse the JSON that my SheetAsJSON mechanism is exposing. I\u2019m also using the [clj-http](https:\/\/github.com\/dakrone\/clj-http) HTTP client library (line 3) to make the GET request. Finally I\u2019m using the [clojure.walk](https:\/\/clojuredocs.org\/clojure.walk) library (line 4) for a really useful function later on.\n\nI decided to churn through step by step,\u00a0which is why you\u2019re seeing this code in four chunks, each time using the def special form to\u00a0create a var in the current namespace.\n\n\n## Creating stats\n\nThere\u2019s stats (line 6), which has the value of the parsed JSON from the body of the response to the HTTP GET request. To unravel\u00a0lines 6-9 we have to\u00a0read from the inside outwards.\n\nFirst, there\u2019s the call to client\/get in line 9 (the clj-http library is aliased as client in line 3). This makes the HTTP GET request and the result is a Persistent Array Map that looks something like this:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(client\/get \"http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014\")** {:cookies {\"NID\" {:discard false, :domain \".googleusercontent.com\", :expires #inst \"2015-07-05T12:23:49.000-00:00\", :path \"\/\", :secure false, :value \"67=EUPTfvAv3U5Vofm1F3Fb_D9OjmwYS1yC3Ju-uvgostmqzKSNLHKHiHGMc-cwFBAES0R3qcLFQW7W75x6sZjSzein3H7Trxeg6Bk0wOJ0q-AaYXA0RxYw0-uEhR5ogaXg\", :version 0}}, :orig-content-encoding nil, :trace-redirects [\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014\" \"https:\/\/script.googleusercontent.com\/macros\/echo?user_content_key=jmP [...] 5, :status 200, :headers {\"Server\" \"GSE\", \"Content-Type\" \"application\/json; charset=utf-8\", \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" \"*\", \"X-Content-Type-Options\" \"nosniff\", \"X-Frame-Options\" \"SAMEORIGIN\", \"Connection\" \"close\", \"Pragma\" \"no-cache\", \"Alternate-Protocol\" \"443:quic,p=0.02\", \"Expires\" \"Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT\", \"P3P\" \"CP=\\\"This is not a P3P policy!

Looking at the keys of the map, we see the following, which should be somewhat familiar to anyone who has made HTTP calls:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(keys (client\/get \"http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014\"))** (:cookies :orig-content-encoding :trace-redirects :request-time :status :headers :body)\n\nThere we can see the :body keyword, which we use on line 8\u00a0as an accessor in this collection. With this, we get the raw body, a string, representing the JSON:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(:body (client\/get \"http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014\"))** \"{\\\"Year-2014\\\":[{\\\"Date\\\":\\\"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\\"Description\\\":\\\"First run of 2014\\\",\\\"Distance\\\":\\\"13.50 km\\\",\\\"Time\\\":\\\"1h:13m:51s\\\",\\\"Avg_Speed\\\":\\\"11.0 km\/h\\\",\\\"Avg_Pace\\\":\\\"5:28 min\/km\\\",\\\"Avg_HR\\\":168,\\\"Distance_Value\\\":13.5,\\\"Pace_Value\\\":\\\"1899-12-30T05:28:00.000Z\\\",\\\"Pace_Val_Mins\\\":5,\\\"Pace_Val_Secs\\\":28,\\\"Pace_In_Secs\\\":328,\\\"Month_of_Run\\\":1},{\\\"Dat [...]\n\nNow we need to parse this JSON with the data.json library, which we do in line 7.\u00a0This gives us something like this:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(json\/read-str (:body (client\/get \"http:\/\/bit.ly\/qmacro-running-2014\")))** {\"Year-2014\" [{\"Pace_Val_Secs\" 28, \"Distance_Value\" 13.5, \"Date\" \"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\", \"Month_of_Run\" 1, \"Description\" \"First run of 2014\", \"Distance\" \"13.50 km\", \"Avg_Speed\" \"11.0 km\/h\", \"Pace_Val_Mins\" 5, \"Pace_Value\" \"1899-12-30T05:28:00.000Z\", \"Avg_Pace\" \"5:28 min\/km\", \"Time\" \"1h:13m:51s\", \"Pace_In_Secs\" 328, \"Avg_HR\" 168} {\"Pace_Val_Secs\" 27, \"Distance_Value\" 14.05, \"Date\" \"2014-01-05T00:00:00.000Z\", \"Month_of_Run\" 1, \"Description\" \"Wet and windy Cop [...]\n\nwhich is eminently more useable as it\u2019s another map.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s a map, the keys are strings which aren\u2019t ideal if we want to take advantage of some Clojure idioms. I may be wrong here, but I found that converting the keys into keywords made things simpler and felt more natural, as you\u2019ll see shortly.\n\n\n## The Year-2014 data set\n\nLines 11-13 is where we create the Year-2014 var, representing the data set in the main spreadsheet tab.\n\nLooking up the \u201cYear-2014\u2033 key in the stats (line 13) gave me a vector, signified by the opening square bracket:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(stats \"Year-2014\")** [{\"Pace_Val_Secs\" 28, \"Distance_Value\" 13.5, \"Date\" \"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\", \"Month_of_Run\" 1, \"Description\" \"First run of 2014\", \"Distance\" \"13.50 km\", \"Avg_Speed\" \"11.0 km\/h\", \"Pace_Val_Mins\" 5, \"Pace_Value\" \"1899-12-30T05:28:00.000Z\", \"Avg_Pace\" \"5:28 min\/km\", \"Time\" \"1h:13m:51s\", \"Pace_In_Secs\" 328, \"Avg_HR\" 168} {\"Pace_Val_Secs\" 27, \"Distance_Value\" 14.05, \"Date\" \"2014-01-05T00:00:00.000Z\", \"Month_of_Run\" 1, \"Description\" \"Wet and windy Copster Hill.\",\n\nThe vector contained maps, one for each run. Each map had strings as keys, so in line 12 I used the [keywordize-keys](https:\/\/clojuredocs.org\/clojure.walk\/keywordize-keys)\u00a0function, from clojure.walk, to transform the strings to keywords. Here\u2019s an example, calling the function on the map representing the first run in the vector:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(keywordize-keys (first (stats \"Year-2014\")))** {:Pace_Value \"1899-12-30T05:28:00.000Z\", :Month_of_Run 1, :Distance_Value 13.5, :Distance \"13.50 km\", :Avg_HR 168, :Avg_Pace \"5:28 min\/km\", :Pace_Val_Mins 5, :Pace_Val_Secs 28, :Date \"2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z\", :Description \"First run of 2014\", :Time \"1h:13m:51s\", :Avg_Speed \"11.0 km\/h\", :Pace_In_Secs 328}\n\nI assigned the resulting value of this call to a new var Year-2014.\n\n\n## Getting the HR values\n\nThe Garmin Forerunner 110 measures heart rate (HR) via a chest strap, and an average-HR detail is available for each run:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(:Avg_HR (first Year-2014))** 168\n\nThere were a few runs where I didn\u2019t wear the chest strap, so the value for this detail on those runs was a dash, rather than a number, in the running statistics on the Endomondo website, which found its way into the spreadsheet and the JSON.\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(count (filter (comp not number?) (map :Avg_HR Year-2014)))** 6\n\nYes, six runs altogether without an average HR value. So to get the real average HR values, I just needed the ones that were numbers. I did this on lines 15-17.\n\n*By the way, composing with the [comp](https:\/\/clojuredocs.org\/clojure.core\/comp) function sort of makes me go \u201cwow\u201d, because I figure\u00a0this is revealing a bit of the simplicity, depth and philosophy that lies beneath the scratch mark I\u2019ve just made in the surface of functional programming in general and Clojure in particular.*\n\n\n## Average HR\n\nI took the average of the HR values in line 21. This actually returned a\u00a0Ratio type:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(\/ (reduce + HR-values) (count HR-values))** 15292\/95 running-stats.core=> **(type (\/ (reduce + HR-values) (count HR-values)))** clojure.lang.Ratio\n\nThis was interesting in itself, but I wanted a value that told me something, so I called the float function in line 20:\n\nrunning-stats.core=> **(float (\/ (reduce + HR-values) (count HR-values)))** 160.96841\n\n(Yes, I know taking the average of averages is not a great thing to do, but at this stage I\u2019m more interested in my Clojure learning than my running HR in 2014).\n\n\n## And more\n\nI did continue with my analysis in Clojure, but this post is already long enough, so I\u2019ll leave it there for now. If you got this far, thanks for reading! I hope to teach myself more Clojure; there are some great resources online, and the community is second to none.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of taking the plunge, I\u2019d recommend it! I\u2019ll leave you with a quote from [David Nolen](http:\/\/swannodette.github.io\/) at the end of his talk \u201c[Jelly Stains. Thoughts on JavaScript, Lisp and Play](http:\/\/youtu.be\/AnzMEdC2FDk)\u201d at JSConf 2012:\n\n> \u201c[Dan Friedman and William Byrd] got me realising there\u2019s a lot more left to play with in Computer Science\u201d.\n\nAs I embark upon my journey in this direction, I realise that\u2019s a very true statement. It\u2019s like learning programming all over again, in a good way!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>I enjoyed running in 2014 and logged each one via <a href=\"https:\/\/www.endomondo.com\/profile\/1074038\">Endomondo<\/a>.

Although I don&#8217;t actually have to think about Maven at all, Leiningen does it all for me, and my hair is not on fire (for those of you wondering, Leiningen&#8217;s tagline is &#8220;for automating\u00a0Clojure projects without setting your hair on fire&#8221;, which I like).<\/p>\n<p>So I used Leiningen to create a new application project:<\/p>\n<pre>lein new app running-stats<\/pre>\n<p>and used my joint-favourite editor (Vim, obviously, along with Atom), with some super Clojure-related plugins such as <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/tpope\/vim-fireplace\">vim-fireplace,<\/a> to edit the core.clj file.

It\u2019s a great honour to have been invited, and I\u2019m excited at the prospect of the topics covered in the [agenda](http:\/\/www.masteringsap.co.za\/tech\/agenda).\n\nI\u2019m continuing my journey spreading the word about Fiori and UI5. Last November I was in Sydney giving a locknote, a workshop and speaking at an executive lunch, at the [SAP Architect & Developer Summit](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/11\/the-inaugural-sap-architect-developer-summit\/). A couple of weeks ago it was a short trip to Brussels to speak about [OpenUI5 at FOSDEM](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/02\/openui5-at-fosdem-2015\/), and now at Mastering SAP I have three slots. Here\u2019s the description of each of them.\n\n**[Keynote: Can I Build a Fiori App? Yes You Can!](http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyqz\/)**\n\nFiori is not just the new UX-focused, role-based application paradigm from SAP, it\u2019s also a set of technical constraints coupled with a rich but finite set of design patterns for UI. Most importantly it\u2019s made possible by certain parts of the SAPUI5 toolkit that were specifically built with Fiori in mind. (In fact, the first customers of the sap.m library in SAPUI5 were the SAP Fiori developers themselves). This session tells you what you need to know to build a Fiori app.\n\n**[Tips & Tricks from the Trenches of a Fiori\/UI5 Developer](http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyrb\/)**\n\nDeveloping Fiori and UI5 apps with the UI5 toolkit is different than what you\u2019re used to. Different generally because it\u2019s HTML5 based, and different specifically because it\u2019s UI5. Learn the tips and tricks that I use on a daily basis, and get to know how to drive, modify and extend Fiori\/UI5 apps from the command line console of Chrome\u2019s developer tools. Master UI5 debugging and maintenance from within the browser and get a step ahead.\n\n**[Workshop: Building an SAP Fiori-like App From (Almost) Scratch \u2013 Hands On!](http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyrc\/)**\n\nStarting from a skeleton app that has a structure but minimal content, and an OData or JSON data source, we build together a working Fiori app with SAPUI5.

It&#8217;s a great honour to have been invited, and I&#8217;m excited at the prospect of the topics covered in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.masteringsap.co.za\/tech\/agenda\">agenda<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continuing my journey spreading the word about Fiori and UI5. Last November I was in Sydney giving a locknote, a workshop and speaking at an executive lunch, at the <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/11\/the-inaugural-sap-architect-developer-summit\/\">SAP Architect &amp; Developer Summit<\/a>. A couple of weeks ago it was a short trip to Brussels to speak about <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/02\/openui5-at-fosdem-2015\/\">OpenUI5 at FOSDEM<\/a>, and now at Mastering SAP I have three slots. Here&#8217;s the description of each of them.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyqz\/\">Keynote: Can I Build a Fiori App? Yes You Can!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fiori is not just the new UX-focused, role-based application paradigm from SAP, it&#8217;s also a set of technical constraints coupled with a rich but finite set of design patterns for UI. Most importantly it&#8217;s made possible by certain parts of the SAPUI5 toolkit that were specifically built with Fiori in mind. (In fact, the first customers of the sap.m library in SAPUI5 were the SAP Fiori developers themselves). This session tells you what you need to know to build a Fiori app.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyrb\/\">Tips &amp; Tricks from the Trenches of a Fiori\/UI5 Developer<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Developing Fiori and UI5 apps with the UI5 toolkit is different than what you&#8217;re used to. Different generally because it&#8217;s HTML5 based, and different specifically because it&#8217;s UI5. Learn the tips and tricks that I use on a daily basis, and get to know how to drive, modify and extend Fiori\/UI5 apps from the command line console of Chrome&#8217;s developer tools. Master UI5 debugging and maintenance from within the browser and get a step ahead.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/lanyrd.com\/2015\/masteringsap\/sdfyrc\/\">Workshop: Building an SAP Fiori-like App From (Almost) Scratch &#8211; Hands On!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting from a skeleton app that has a structure but minimal content, and an OData or JSON data source, we build together a working Fiori app with SAPUI5. We cover bootstrapping the SAPUI5 toolkit, the Component-based approach to development, Model-View-Controller based development, XML views, navigation, data binding, model operations and more. This is similar to the Open Source Convention (OSCON) hands-on session I co-presented in Portland, June 2014, and the CD168 hands-on sessions I co-built &amp; co-presented at SAP TechEd in 2013 (which were sold out \/ overbooked many times).<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll see some of you there.

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and I do like challenges to assumptions and the status quo, so I enjoyed the article. I thought it would be worth responding with a similar piece, albeit with a slightly different title :-)\n\nIt would be an odd situation indeed for a unified consensus on any software, let alone software in this particular context \u2013 HTML5 development toolkits and frameworks, where, if you don\u2019t have an opinion, you\u2019re looked upon as an outsider. So I wanted to state before I start that there is no single correct answer, or even a single toolkit to rule them all, and Greg makes some important points.\n\nI thought I\u2019d\u00a0look\u00a0at the individual points that Greg made.\n\n**\u201cProprietary framework, no thanks.\u201d\u00a0**\n\nAs a lot of folks already know, UI5 is far from proprietary. It is written and maintained by web developers that work for an enterprise software behemoth, but the key difference is that UI5 has been open sourced, as well as using many open source libraries itself. In the article there\u2019s the contrast made between \u201cproprietary\u201d and \u201cindustry standard\u201d as though they\u2019re opposites. This is not the case. So I\u2019m not sure whether the criticism being levelled at UI5 is about its proprietary nature (which is not the case) or about (not) being an industry standard. This latter point is debatable: A toolkit powering frontend software across the entire ERP landscape for SAP customers feels like a de facto industry standard to me. Yes, not every company has adopted Fiori, but for one that drives its business on SAP products, UI5 is a likely software component.\n\nI\u2019m curious about the \u201cSAP quirks\u201d phrase which is also mentioned in this point. I\u2019m not sure which quirks are being referred to, but if industrial strength design, MVC, internationalisation, automatic support for RTL languages, client and server side model support and an accomplished data binding system are SAP quirks, then yes please!\n\nFurther, AngularJS is mentioned as a framework with a huge community behind it. From what I can see, that community is fracturing, due to the major upheaval in (re)design between the 1.x and 2.x versions. That\u2019s not to say that this couldn\u2019t happen to UI5, but it\u2019s actually happening right now with that framework.\n\n**\u201cSAP Backend Upgrade?\u201d**\n\nTo do UI5-based apps \u201cproperly\u201d, or \u201cthe SAP way\u201d, then this is true; if you don\u2019t already have a Gateway system in your ABAP stack landscape, then you\u2019ll need one and also the UI2 add-in with which the UI5 runtime is supplied.\n\nIn my experience, however, it\u2019s increasingly less common for an enterprise to not have a Gateway system somewhere; and with NetWeaver 7.40 you get the components built in as standard anyway. Further, installing Gateway components is often a coffee time activity.\n\nBut not wanting to over-trivialise this important original point, I wanted to point out the alternative; an alternative that is the most likely scenario anyway for a non-UI5 deployment such as AngularJS: a separate web server. You can just as easily host and serve your UI5 based applications, along with the UI5 runtime, from a web server of your choice. Then accessing the backend becomes the same task as if you\u2019d chosen a different (non-UI5) framework.\n\nAnd on the subject of accessing the backend, the point that was made about \u201cremote enabled functions\u201d does intrigue me. One of the advantages of UI5 is that it supports OData, an open standard, by the way, and one of the advantages of OData in turn is that it is a server-side model.\n\nCalling remote function modules in this day and age is certainly possible and sometimes the only choice, but you\u2019re not going to take advantage of server-side heavy lifting when it comes to data integration with your frontend. I\u2019ve built Web-based apps with SAP remote function calls since the 90s, so I have the scars :-) Not only that, but the data abstraction model presented by the RFC approach is somewhat orthogonal to modern web based app data mechanisms.\n\n**\u201cBrowser Support\u201d**\n\nThis is of course always an interesting issue, but as an individual developer, and as a member of a development team, I prefer a solid statement about a well defined set of modern browsers which are supported by the toolkit I use, rather than have to do that job myself and deal with the vagaries that present themselves on a daily basis. Of course, rolling your own gives more flexibility, but it\u2019s often more work.\n\nAnd at least for the clients that I work at, the fact that (a) the browser choice is usually somewhat controlled anyway, and (b) the fact that in the BYOD context people even choose (choose!) to bring Windows phones, which are supported by UI5, underlines that choice for me.\n\n**\u201cFrontend Developers Don\u2019t Care\u201d**\n\nAt the risk of appearing obtuse, I\u2019m going to absolutely disagree with this statement :-) Frontend developers *do* care; they care about the quality of the software they work with, about how and whether the toolkit they use [does the job without getting in the way](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/March-2015\/Can-I-build-a-Fiori-app-Yes-you-can!\/). Of course, this caring, this obsessive compulsion to be using the right framework and doing the right thing may mean that for some developers the choice is something other than UI5.\n\nAnd that would be fine. There is no one piece of software that fits all requirements or circumstances, in any context. In the past I have used jQueryUI, JQTouch, AngularJS and other frameworks. And I would never rule them out for future projects. But right now, I\u2019m investing time and effort in UI5, because it\u2019s open source, it\u2019s enterprise ready, it\u2019s been designed & built and is maintained by committed, passionate designers and developers just like you and me (well, a lot more competent than me) and it is also fully in tune with SAP\u2019s technology directions.\n\nSkills in UI5 are going to be useful not only for building out the current and next generation of proper outside-in apps, but also for supporting the deployments, customisations and extensions for Fiori. A nice side effect at which one should not sniff.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>I recently came across an article by Greg Donaldson &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/createsend.com\/t\/r-1D458A2147210E112540EF23F30FEDED\" target=\"_blank\">Why We Are Staying Clear of SAPUI5<\/a>&#8220;.

I mentioned that while the Fiori Apps Library app itself didn\u2019t expose the information in that way, the data was actually available, and [laid down a challenge](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LanZx1W2yqI#t=18m10s) for anyone to make the app do just that.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-03-20 at 16.03.06](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-20-at-16.03.06-248x300.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-20-at-16.03.06.png)Just a few days later the first response\u00a0appeared \u2013\u00a0[Gregor Brett came up with a nice solution](http:\/\/gregorbrett.blogspot.co.uk\/2015\/03\/ive-just-watched-this-interesting-video.html), which was to patch the running Fiori Apps Library app, adding a new View Settings Filter Item to the filterItems aggregation of the actual View Settings Dialog used in the app. The items\u00a0within that new\u00a0View Settings Filter Item were bound to a data collection that was already being exposed by the backend in the OData service, namely the Releases_EV collection, which gave information on Fiori Wave numbers and dates.\n\nBingo! Nice work Gregor.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**[The Fiori Community](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/fiori) by the SAP Community Network  \n**Since the last episode of TWIF last year in October, SAP have [created a new community](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/fiori\/blog\/2015\/02\/25\/sap-fiori--the-new-community-space-in-scn) within the SAP Community Network for Fiori. There\u2019s already a community for SAPUI5, but now there\u2019s a specific community for Fiori. I spoke about this in my keynote at Mastering SAP Technologies last month, and it\u2019s an interesting and important distinction that SAP are making.\n\nIf you think about it, Fiori as an umbrella term is gigantic. It could be seen as a lot of things to a lot of people. Separating out the technical underpinnings (UI5) from other aspects (Fiori application configuration, extension and maintenance, UX design, deployment and platform subjects, and more) was only going to be a matter of time, if only to make the subjects more manageable.\n\nBut also remember that future Fiori offerings from SAP may not be powered by UI5. Of course, all of the Fiori offerings now and in the near future are, including all the S\/4HANA applications such as the SFIN set, but when you consider SAP\u2019s purchases \u2013\u00a0Ariba, Concur\u00a0and\u00a0SuccessFactors to name but three \u2013 a unified UX strategy is not going to happen from re-engineering the whole UI\/UX layer of those (previously) third party products.\n\nVisit the new SAP Fiori community and have a look around.

The Fiori juggernaut continues to rumble on, and this week was no exception. Let\u2019s get to it!\n\n**[Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud](https:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/fiux1) by openSAP  \n**This week saw the start of the new free course at openSAP, which, according to the description, is all about \u201cbuilding your own SAP Fiori app that\u2019s just as delightful and user-friendly as any of the hundreds SAP has built directly\u201d.\n\nThis is great news, especially for those of us who had signed up to the earlier course \u201cIntroduction to SAP Fiori UX\u201d but had been rather disappointed that it had had nothing much to do with Fiori UX, and more to do with deployment and setup. I wrote about this in [TWIF episode 2014-40](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/10\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-40\/). A number of us did have a dialogue with the openSAP folks at the time, and I\u2019m delighted to see our comments were taken on board \u2013 this new course looks to be what we have been waiting for.\n\nSo we\u2019re into Week 1 of this new nine week course, and already in the last unit of Week 1 \u2014 Unit 5, Introduction to SAPUI5 and OData \u2014 we\u2019re seeing JSON and XML on the slides, HTTP headers, and even a small glimpse at the superb UI5 toolkit, including a tiny controller and an XML View definition. This is more like it! Technical details on the slides.\n\nDon\u2019t get too excited, however. I spotted some errors in this unit that aren\u2019t trivial. I\u2019ve built courses before and I know how hard it is to get things consistent, but one thing you must do is be accurate. Here are some of the things I spotted:\n\n*\u201cOData \u2026 is using SOAP and REST to communicate between systems\u201d  \n*OK, so first, REST isn\u2019t a protocol, it\u2019s an architectural style, so it is difficult to use a style to communicate between systems. But that is sort of forgivable, in that perhaps more accurately one could say that the OData protocol has RESTful tendencies. But SOAP? No. OData has nothing to do with SOAP, in fact, one could say that the OData protocol is orthogonal to SOAP.\n\n*\u201cOne of the most important libraries we have today is sap.ui.m\u201d*  \n I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s just a typo that found its way up through the layers to the actual presentation script. Because while there are libraries with the sap.ui prefix, there is no sap.ui.m. What the instructor is referring to is [sap.m](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.html). The m originally stood for \u201cmobile\u201d, but now stands for \u201cmain\u201d. The sap.m library is one of the main collections\u00a0of responsive controls which are used to build Fiori apps. For more info, you might want to read \u201c[M is for \u2018responsive\u2019](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/February-2014\/M-is-for-responsive\/)\u201c.\n\n*\u201cWe have a library [sap.ui.table] for table, and that provides me with the ability to\u00a0create a table that is\u00a0very rich in data but also responsive\u201d*  \n For responsive tables, you probably want to look at the [sap.m.Table](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.Table\/samples) control, rather than the sap.ui.table library, as the former is designed from the ground up to be responsive, whereas the latter is more for desktop apps.\n\n*MVC \u2013 View <-> Model data binding  \n*In slide 13, there\u2019s a classic MVC style diagram, but the data binding relationship between the view and the model seems to be shown as one way only:\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.12.27](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.12.27-300x47.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.12.27.png)\n\nOne of the many features of the powerful model mechanism and the data binding therein is that you can have two way binding. So I\u2019d have drawn that arrow pointing both ways.\n\n*XML View definition*  \n Being a stickler for accuracy (perhaps to the point of pedantry, of which I\u2019m proud, not apologetic :-), this XML View definition on slide 14 is not quite accurate:\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.15.27](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.15.27.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.15.27.png)\n\nThe View is within the sap.ui.core.mvc namespace, not the sap.ui.core namespace, so the root element here should reflect that, like this:\n\n<mvc:View xmlns:mvc=\u201dsap.ui.core.mvc\u201d \u2026\n\n*Router? Bueller?  \n*So if I\u2019m going all out, I might as well mention that one thing that I think slide 16 could have benefitted from is mention of the Router in the architecture overview diagram. I do appreciate that these slides may have come from a time before the Router concept was properly established, but the Router is an incredibly important part of any Fiori app, so it would have really helped to see it here.\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.21.38](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.21.38.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.21.38.png)\n\nThat said, now you know, you can go and find out more about it! :-)\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m very excited about this course, and these issues can be ironed out now they\u2019ve been surfaced. I\u2019m looking forward very much to Week 2.\n\n**[Fiori Breakfast Event](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/About-us\/News-and-Media\/Events\/Fiori-breakfast-event\/) by [Brenton O\u2019Callaghan](https:\/\/twitter.com\/callaghan001), [Lindsay Stanger](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/Lindsay-Stanger\/) and me**  \n On Tuesdsay morning this week in London, Brenton, Lindsay and I, along with other great Bluefin folks, ran a breakfast event\u00a0all about Fiori. It was a really successful gathering, with business and technical attendees from SAP customer companies who were already, or were about to, or were just interested in embarking upon their Fiori journey. We had a special guest from one of our clients too, and to be honest, she stole the show :-)\n\nIt was clear from the event that people are realising that Fiori is not only here, it\u2019s here to stay, and it\u2019s a journey that is not just about new apps, but about a new SAP. If you\u2019re reading this TWIF column, you already know that. It\u2019s a genuinely exciting time for us as customers, partners and consultants, not only because of the UX aspect, but also because the present and future that is Fiori is based upon open technology standards that are right.

The Fiori juggernaut continues to rumble on, and this week was no exception. Let&#8217;s get to it!<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/fiux1\">Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud<\/a> by openSAP<br \/>\n<\/strong>This week saw the start of the new free course at openSAP, which, according to the description, is all about &#8220;building your own SAP Fiori app that&#8217;s just as delightful and user-friendly as any of the hundreds SAP has built directly&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>This is great news, especially for those of us who had signed up to the earlier course &#8220;Introduction to SAP Fiori UX&#8221; but had been rather disappointed that it had had nothing much to do with Fiori UX, and more to do with deployment and setup. I wrote about this in <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/10\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-40\/\">TWIF episode 2014-40<\/a>. A number of us did have a dialogue with the openSAP folks at the time, and I&#8217;m delighted to see our comments were taken on board &#8211; this new course looks to be what we have been waiting for.<\/p>\n<p>So we&#8217;re into Week 1 of this new nine week course, and already in the last unit of Week 1 &#8212; Unit 5, Introduction to SAPUI5 and OData &#8212; we&#8217;re seeing JSON and XML on the slides, HTTP headers, and even a small glimpse at the superb UI5 toolkit, including a tiny controller and an XML View definition. This is more like it! Technical details on the slides.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get too excited, however. I spotted some errors in this unit that aren&#8217;t trivial. I&#8217;ve built courses before and I know how hard it is to get things consistent, but one thing you must do is be accurate. Here are some of the things I spotted:<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;OData &#8230; is using SOAP and REST to communicate between systems&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/em>OK, so first, REST isn&#8217;t a protocol, it&#8217;s an architectural style, so it is difficult to use a style to communicate between systems. But that is sort of forgivable, in that perhaps more accurately one could say that the OData protocol has RESTful tendencies. But SOAP? No. OData has nothing to do with SOAP, in fact, one could say that the OData protocol is orthogonal to SOAP.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;One of the most important libraries we have today is sap.ui.m&#8221;<\/em><br \/>\nI&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s just a typo that found its way up through the layers to the actual presentation script. Because while there are libraries with the sap.ui prefix, there is no sap.ui.m. What the instructor is referring to is <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.html\">sap.m<\/a>. The m originally stood for &#8220;mobile&#8221;, but now stands for &#8220;main&#8221;. The sap.m library is one of the main collections\u00a0of responsive controls which are used to build Fiori apps. For more info, you might want to read &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/February-2014\/M-is-for-responsive\/\">M is for &#8216;responsive&#8217;<\/a>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We have a library [sap.ui.table] for table, and that provides me with the ability to\u00a0create a table that is\u00a0very rich in data but also responsive&#8221;<\/em><br \/>\nFor responsive tables, you probably want to look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.Table\/samples\">sap.m.Table<\/a> control, rather than the sap.ui.table library, as the former is designed from the ground up to be responsive, whereas the latter is more for desktop apps.<\/p>\n<p><em>MVC &#8211; View &lt;-&gt; Model data binding<br \/>\n<\/em>In slide 13, there&#8217;s a classic MVC style diagram, but the data binding relationship between the view and the model seems to be shown as one way only:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.12.27.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1947\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.12.27-300x47.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.12.27\" width=\"300\" height=\"47\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>One of the many features of the powerful model mechanism and the data binding therein is that you can have two way binding. So I&#8217;d have drawn that arrow pointing both ways.<\/p>\n<p><em>XML View definition<\/em><br \/>\nBeing a stickler for accuracy (perhaps to the point of pedantry, of which I&#8217;m proud, not apologetic :-), this XML View definition on slide 14 is not quite accurate:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.15.27.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1948 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.15.27.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.15.27\" width=\"557\" height=\"62\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The View is within the sap.ui.core.mvc namespace, not the sap.ui.core namespace, so the root element here should reflect that, like this:<\/p>\n<p>&lt;mvc:View xmlns:mvc=&#8221;sap.ui.core.mvc&#8221; &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em>Router? Bueller?<br \/>\n<\/em>So if I&#8217;m going all out, I might as well mention that one thing that I think slide 16 could have benefitted from is mention of the Router in the architecture overview diagram. I do appreciate that these slides may have come from a time before the Router concept was properly established, but the Router is an incredibly important part of any Fiori app, so it would have really helped to see it here.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.21.38.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1950 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screenshot-2015-03-28-at-14.21.38.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2015-03-28 at 14.21.38\" width=\"456\" height=\"284\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>That said, now you know, you can go and find out more about it! :-)<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m very excited about this course, and these issues can be ironed out now they&#8217;ve been surfaced. I&#8217;m looking forward very much to Week 2.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/About-us\/News-and-Media\/Events\/Fiori-breakfast-event\/\">Fiori Breakfast Event<\/a> by <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/callaghan001\">Brenton O&#8217;Callaghan<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/Lindsay-Stanger\/\">Lindsay Stanger<\/a> and me<\/strong><br \/>\nOn Tuesdsay morning this week in London, Brenton, Lindsay and I, along with other great Bluefin folks, ran a breakfast event\u00a0all about Fiori. It was a really successful gathering, with business and technical attendees from SAP customer companies who were already, or were about to, or were just interested in embarking upon their Fiori journey. We had a special guest from one of our clients too, and to be honest, she stole the show :-)<\/p>\n<p>It was clear from the event that people are realising that Fiori is not only here, it&#8217;s here to stay, and it&#8217;s a journey that is not just about new apps, but about a new SAP. If you&#8217;re reading this TWIF column, you already know that. It&#8217;s a genuinely exciting time for us as customers, partners and consultants, not only because of the UX aspect, but also because the present and future that is Fiori is based upon open technology standards that are right. SAP has grasped the nettle of user experience, and embraced the right tools and technologies.

Let\u2019s go!\n\n**[FIORI Notes 1 : One UX to Rule them All](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/abap\/blog\/2015\/04\/01\/fiori-notes-1-one-ux-to-rule-them-all) by Wilbert Sison**  \n This week saw a simple post by Wilbert summarising a few of the key places to visit on one\u2019s journey to Fiori enlightenment: The [Fiori Cloud Edition Trial](http:\/\/demo-fioritrial.dispatcher.hana.ondemand.com\/), the [Fiori Apps Library](http:\/\/www.sap.com\/fiori-apps-library)\u00a0and the UI5 [Explored](https:\/\/sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com\/sdk\/explored.html) app within the SAPUI5 SDK (the more I ponder the name and the purpose and what it\u2019s becoming, perhaps we should rename it from Explored to *Explorer*). What caught my eye with this post is that it was published in the [ABAP Development](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/abap\/blog) section of the SAP Community Network, and it also gave rise to a short discussion on UI access to HANA.\n\nFirst, the place the post was published. Fiori, and by direct inference UI5, is a cornerstone technology for SAP\u2019s product landscape. What this means in practical terms is that we as SAP technicians need to embrace UI5 as much as we embraced dynpro technologies in the past. It\u2019s that big. Having given a 3 day course on Fiori, UI5 and Gateway\/OData last week, with my co-presenter [Lindsay Stanger](www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/Lindsay-Stanger\/), to a collection of Web and ABAP developers (their own self-descriptions), it\u2019s worth re-iterating the reality for many of us out there; many of us so-called ABAP developers. For me, the concept of an \u201cABAP developer\u201d is somewhere between \u201cmeaningless\u201d and \u201cunneccessarily restricting\u201d. Yes, there are developers out there that call themselves \u201c<language> developers\u201d or \u201c<platform> developers\u201d, and that is their perogative, but it\u2019s an artificial constraint that is not helpful, and reminds me of \u201cCOBOL developer\u201d. There will always be (in the forseeable future) demand for some COBOL skills, but is that the entirety of your outlook? If a mainframe dinosaur and ABAP developer like me can embrace UI5, so can you.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the question of UI, that came up in the comments to Wilbert\u2019s\u00a0post. It reminded me of a [great Twitter thread initiated by John Moy](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jhmoy\/status\/583069583495446528)\u00a0where the frontend future for S\/4 was discussed. I\u2019ll leave it to you to enjoy reading that thread, but the takeaway for me was that people do understand that while wall-to-wall Fiori might be the vision, the reality will be different, particularly in the transition period while the Fiori app suites are constructed and made available. And for those of you pondering the earlier point about ABAP, and this one where SAPGUI and therefore dynpro is not going to disappear any time soon, think of COBOL again ;-)\n\n**April New App Distribution via SAP Fiori Apps Library**  \n The SAP Fiori Apps Library is lots of things rolled into one. It\u2019s a nice talking point and focus for the Fiori pundits, an example of a publically accessible Fiori App\u00a0(where, being Web native, the frontend source code is available for perusing and learning from), and a good source of information on current Fiori apps. And I don\u2019t mean just human readable information, but machine readable data too. I\u2019d exhorted SAP back in August last year\u00a0(in [TWIF episode 2014-35](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2014\/08\/this-week-in-fiori-2014-35\/))\u00a0to make the data available, to supply \u201ca machine readable dataset\u201d. And that they have done, as of course the backend data source to the [SAP Fiori Apps Library](http:\/\/www.sap.com\/fiori-apps-library) tool.\n\nThis of course is an OData source, from a HANA backend, and rich in information. Not only is it useful for powering the Fiori Apps Library app itself, but also for our own data-based analysis. You might have seen my post from earlier this year,\u00a0where I showed you how to pull data from this very OData source into a spreadsheet:\n\n[Fiori App Data into a Spreadsheet? Challenge Accepted!](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/01\/fiori-app-data-into-a-spreadsheet-challenge-accepted\/)\n\nThing is, while this data is valuable in and of itself, if you add a further dimension, time, it becomes perhaps even more valuable. What are the apps that are appearing over time, over the different waves? Are there any that are disappearing? Current total app count as of today is 541. Last month (an unscientifically and deliberately vague point in time, for now) it was 495. So that\u2019s 46 new apps that have appeared (none disappeared, I also checked).\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-04-05 at 13.46.17](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screenshot-2015-04-05-at-13.46.17.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screenshot-2015-04-05-at-13.46.17.png)\n\nI think it might be a worthwhile exercise to pull this app data on a regular basis, for comparisons over time.

I\u2019ve added a few analysis tabs and one of the products is this breakdown of new apps by area, that I\u2019ve titled \u201cNew Apps Distribution\u201d.\n\nDo you think this is useful?

This week sees the start (for me) of a week off on holiday, but not before I put out this latest episode of TWIF for a quick roundup of things that caught my eye in the world of Fiori. If you have any stories to share, let me know!\n\n**[SAP Fiori Application Development in the Cloud](http:\/\/sapinsider.wispubs.com\/Assets\/Articles\/2015\/April\/SPI-SAP-Fiori-application-development-in-the-cloud) by Monika Kaiser & Karl Kessler**  \n The subtitle of this article in SAPinsider magazine is\u00a0\u201cBuilding, Deploying and Mobilizing Applications for Today\u2019s Enterprises\u201d. And as a great introduction, it certainly delivers on that. Not surprising given Karl\u2019s pedigree in knowing about and writing about SAP technologies :-)\n\nThis is very much a getting started article, but where it scores is in the detailed and annotated set of screenshots that are useful for introducing folks to the whole process of building a Fiori app. Not generally, but specifically using SAP\u2019s HANA Cloud tools, including the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, the SAP Web IDE and SAP Mobile Secure.\n\nThe article does remind me of the conversation I have with many developers at customers and partners as well as with individuals. It usually starts like this: \u201cQ: Should I use SAP Web IDE as my main editor?\u201d closely followed by \u201cA: Well, it depends \u2026\u201d. There\u2019s a mentality, or a mindset, amongst SAP developers that is hard to shake, because of decades of the same experience. As ABAP developers, we\u2019ve been used to having to use SE38, SE80, SE24 and the like. Having the tool question pre-answered for us. And many of us have waited on SAP\u2019s every word, even in the dark days when Eclipse was recommended as *the* development platform**. Now we have a choice, but many are looking to SAP for recommendations. And it makes some sense \u2013 SAP need to invest in building tools for the army of SAP programmers out there for many reasons. With the SAP Web IDE,\u00a0they\u2019ve landed with both feet on the ground, in that it\u2019s not unpleasant to use and it comes with great productivity features that Just Work(tm). What\u2019s more,\u00a0no-one is saying that SAP Web IDE should be your\u00a0*only\u00a0*editor.\n\n<address>**yes, I know that SAP Web IDE is based upon Orion, but you\u2019re not going to convince me that it\u2019s the same thing<\/address>I use SAP Web IDE to start some projects off; I\u2019ve even dabbled with the great plugin and templating system (see \u201c[SAP Fiori Rapid Prototyping: SAP Web IDE and Google Docs](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jAp_nGqOT_c)\u201c), and the test offline version (see \u201c[SAP Web IDE Local Install \u2013 Up and Running](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfctWmgNyOIfF6gbmp_PZGNgn6YVJHfyU)\u201c).

This week sees the start (for me) of a week off on holiday, but not before I put out this latest episode of TWIF for a quick roundup of things that caught my eye in the world of Fiori. If you have any stories to share, let me know!<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/sapinsider.wispubs.com\/Assets\/Articles\/2015\/April\/SPI-SAP-Fiori-application-development-in-the-cloud\">SAP Fiori Application Development in the Cloud<\/a> by Monika Kaiser &amp; Karl Kessler<\/strong><br \/>\nThe subtitle of this article in SAPinsider magazine is\u00a0&#8220;Building, Deploying and Mobilizing Applications for Today&#8217;s Enterprises&#8221;. And as a great introduction, it certainly delivers on that. Not surprising given Karl&#8217;s pedigree in knowing about and writing about SAP technologies :-)<\/p>\n<p>This is very much a getting started article, but where it scores is in the detailed and annotated set of screenshots that are useful for introducing folks to the whole process of building a Fiori app. Not generally, but specifically using SAP&#8217;s HANA Cloud tools, including the SAP HANA Cloud Platform, the SAP Web IDE and SAP Mobile Secure.<\/p>\n<p>The article does remind me of the conversation I have with many developers at customers and partners as well as with individuals. It usually starts like this: &#8220;Q: Should I use SAP Web IDE as my main editor?&#8221; closely followed by &#8220;A: Well, it depends &#8230;&#8221;. There&#8217;s a mentality, or a mindset, amongst SAP developers that is hard to shake, because of decades of the same experience. As ABAP developers, we&#8217;ve been used to having to use SE38, SE80, SE24 and the like. Having the tool question pre-answered for us. And many of us have waited on SAP&#8217;s every word, even in the dark days when Eclipse was recommended as <em>the<\/em> development platform**. Now we have a choice, but many are looking to SAP for recommendations. And it makes some sense &#8211; SAP need to invest in building tools for the army of SAP programmers out there for many reasons. With the SAP Web IDE,\u00a0they&#8217;ve landed with both feet on the ground, in that it&#8217;s not unpleasant to use and it comes with great productivity features that Just Work(tm). What&#8217;s more,\u00a0no-one is saying that SAP Web IDE should be your\u00a0<em>only\u00a0<\/em>editor.<\/p>\n<address>**yes, I know that SAP Web IDE is based upon Orion, but you&#8217;re not going to convince me that it&#8217;s the same thing<\/address>\n<p>I use SAP Web IDE to start some projects off; I&#8217;ve even dabbled with the great plugin and templating system (see &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jAp_nGqOT_c\">SAP Fiori Rapid Prototyping: SAP Web IDE and Google Docs<\/a>&#8220;), and the test offline version (see &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLfctWmgNyOIfF6gbmp_PZGNgn6YVJHfyU\">SAP Web IDE Local Install &#8211; Up and Running<\/a>&#8220;).

It\u2019s time yet again to share a few newsworthy items that caught my eye this week in the world of Fiori. Let\u2019s get to it!\n\n**[Ariba Total User Experience](https:\/\/youtu.be\/opbypeGLZd0) by Ariba**  \n We start out with something from earlier this month that just came to my attention via an article in SearchSAP \u2013 \u201c[Ariba unveils major overhaul of user interface](http:\/\/searchsap.techtarget.com\/news\/4500244534\/Ariba-unveils-major-overhaul-of-UI)\u201c. At this month\u2019s Ariba Live conference Ariba revealed their new \u201cTotal User Experience\u201d approach to\u00a0improving the user experience for their products. And it comes as no great surprise to see that it is \u2014 as SAP have been saying\u00a0it would be \u2014\u00a0aligned with the SAP Fiori UX approach. Here\u2019s a tweet from Tridip Chakraborthy:\n\n> [#AribaLIVE](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/AribaLIVE?src=hash) Boom Woot Woot ! introducing the [@ariba](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ariba) [#mobile](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/mobile?src=hash) app [#catalog](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/catalog?src=hash) #[#SAPFiori](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/SAPFiori?src=hash) user interface paradigm shift [#UX](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/UX?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com\/8XAZRzMkBJ](http:\/\/t.co\/8XAZRzMkBJ)\n> \n> \u2014 Tridip Chakraborthy (@tridipchakra) [April 9, 2015](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tridipchakra\/status\/586212694644011009)\n\n<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script>\n\nYou can clearly see the huge similarities in UX design and approach even from this one photo. The SearchSAP article states that \u201cthe Ariba UI does not share code with Fiori, but uses the same stylesheets, giving it a similar look and feel\u201d. In a post based on my keynote\u00a0at Mastering SAP Technologies conference earlier this year, titled \u201c[Can I build a Fiori app? Yes you can!](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/Blogs\/DJ-Adams\/March-2015\/Can-I-build-a-Fiori-app-Yes-you-can!\/)\u201c, I\u2019d written:\n\n> If you think about it, that abstraction, that distinction between philosophy and practicality, is the one way SAP can continue to forge ahead with some sort of (eventually) unifying user experience strategy while at the same time dealing with the reality of products from differing sources, with differing frontends \u2013 Concur, Ariba, Lumira, and more.\n\nThat abstraction is clearly in evidence here. I\u2019d be really interested to see more details of how Ariba\u2019s SAP Fiori UX\u00a0\u201cTotal User Experience\u201d looks under the hood, to discover how it ticks. It certainly looks great on the surface!\n\n**[SAP Fiori Practitioners Forum](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/mobile\/blog\/2015\/01\/14\/maximize-your-investment-in-sap-fiori-free-practitioners-forum-best-practices) by Katie Moser**  \n Katie announced this back in January but I\u2019ve only recently joined and I\u2019m looking forward to getting involved and sharing best pratices with the other members. According to the post, this monthly forum is \u201cdesigned to help you drive the successful deployment of SAP Fiori in your organisation\u201d.\n\nI understand that the sessions so far have been very useful. As we have all discovered already, Fiori is a multi faceted thing, and a place to discuss practicalities from design & configuration through rollout\u00a0and beyond, with like minded individuals is a great idea.

So there\u2019s no way that anything can\u00a0***run***in the SAP HCP\u00a0***account.*** The nearest correct answer as far as I could see is (a). But that\u2019s not entirely accurate. However, the ambiguity of this question and the possible answers force me to choose \u201cthe nearest that makes sense\u201d which is (a), as (c) can certainly\u00a0*not* be correct.\n\nAnother example is in the assignment for Week 3, where there\u2019s the following question and 4 possible answers:\n\n*Which end-to-end application development phases are currently supported by SAP Web IDE?*  \n*(a) Prototyping, developing, testing, deploying, and extending*  \n*(b) Requirements management, prototyping, developing, testing, deploying, and extending*  \n*(c) Prototyping, developing, functionality testing, A\\B testing, deploying, and extending*  \n*(d) Developing, testing, deploying, and extending\u00a0*\n\nThe officially correct answer has been marked as (d).\n\nThe official download materials for this week contain, as usual, a complete transcript of all the units, the slides, and the videos. This is great in itself. Unfortunately, the official transcript records exactly what the instructor said, which is (starting at 00:02:22, bold emphasis mine):\n\n*And we do so by **covering the end-to-end application development lifecycle with one tool.\u00a0And when we refer to the end-to-end application lifecycle development, we start from the prototyping of the application**,\u00a0then the development, the testing on the different devices of course, the packaging and the\u00a0deployment into different application landscape\u00a0and then later on after we released the application, also the extension of the application in\u00a0order to customize it\u00a0and make it suitable for the different scenarios and**customers. *\n\nThe slide related to this section looks like this:\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-04-22 at 08.35.41](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screenshot-2015-04-22-at-08.35.41-300x166.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screenshot-2015-04-22-at-08.35.41.png)\n\nSee that tiny couple of words in a footnote in the bottom left?

But I don\u2019t just take the transcript\u2019s word for it \u2026 **I do prototyping** in the SAP Web IDE. I don\u2019t use the Powerpoint-based kit, I build simple views in XML either by hand in the coding editor, or sometimes with the layout editor. So practically speaking, the SAP Web IDE does support prototyping, regardless of what is or is not said.\n\nThe challenge is not the course itself, the content, as I said, is great. The challenge is setting clear questions with unambiguous answers. Here are two occasions (and there have been others, on other openSAP courses in the past) where this is not the case.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about learning and sharing knowledge, and being the best I can be.

It\u2019s great to see this take shape and start to become formalised. Some of them are obvious, at least to some folk,\u00a0but it\u2019s always helpful to have a reference.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at a couple\u00a0of the Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts here.\n\nThe top item\u00a0on my list is \u201cDon\u2019t use private and protected methods or properties of UI5\u2033. Far too often, I see code that refers to internal properties of UI5 controls, especially to the arrays and maps that are managed internally (for the aggregations, for example). I think it\u2019s fair to say that 98% of the time, the use here is totally wrong, and there\u2019s a public API to give you what you want.\u00a0There have been a couple of instances in the past where I\u2019ve seen something for which there appeared no equivalent \u2018legal\u2019 alternative, but that could be down to API maturity, or lack of documentation.\n\nRelated to this item is almost the antithesis, which is to use (create) properties that inadvertently clobber properties of the same name in an existing context. A great example of this is within a controller definition. There\u2019s a nice pattern, which can be seen in many places including the reference apps in the SAP Web IDE, where in any given controller you would create controller properties to refer to the related view, and often the domain or view properties model, in the init event, like this:\n\nsap.ui.controller(\"local.controller\", { _**oView** : null, onInit : function() { this._**oView** = this.getView(); }, onSomeEvent : function(oEvent) { ... this._**oView**.someFunction(...); ... } });\n\nBut sometimes the developer, averse to underscores, will write it like this:\n\nsap.ui.controller(\"local.controller\", { **oView** : null, onInit : function() { this.**oView** = this.getView(); }, onSomeEvent : function(oEvent) { ... this.**oView**.someFunction(...); ... } });\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat actually happens is that the call to\n\nthis.**oView** = this.getView();\n\nis clobbering the internal property oView of \u2018this\u2019 (the controller), which is pointing at the view it\u2019s related to. Luckily what it\u2019s being clobbered with in this small (underscore-less) antipattern is another reference to the\u00a0view itself, so not much immediate harm done, but it\u2019s not entirely safe or future proof.\n\nAnother interesting best practice described in this section of the SDK relates to internationalisation (i18n).

It&#8217;s great to see this take shape and start to become formalised. Some of them are obvious, at least to some folk,\u00a0but it&#8217;s always helpful to have a reference.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at a couple\u00a0of the Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts here.<\/p>\n<p>The top item\u00a0on my list is &#8220;Don&#8217;t use private and protected methods or properties of UI5&#8243;. Far too often, I see code that refers to internal properties of UI5 controls, especially to the arrays and maps that are managed internally (for the aggregations, for example). I think it&#8217;s fair to say that 98% of the time, the use here is totally wrong, and there&#8217;s a public API to give you what you want.\u00a0There have been a couple of instances in the past where I&#8217;ve seen something for which there appeared no equivalent &#8216;legal&#8217; alternative, but that could be down to API maturity, or lack of documentation.<\/p>\n<p>Related to this item is almost the antithesis, which is to use (create) properties that inadvertently clobber properties of the same name in an existing context. A great example of this is within a controller definition. There&#8217;s a nice pattern, which can be seen in many places including the reference apps in the SAP Web IDE, where in any given controller you would create controller properties to refer to the related view, and often the domain or view properties model, in the init event, like this:<\/p>\n<pre>sap.ui.controller(\"local.controller\", {\r\n\r\n  _<strong>oView<\/strong> : null,\r\n \r\n  onInit : function() {\r\n    this._<strong>oView<\/strong> = this.getView();\r\n  },\r\n \r\n  onSomeEvent : function(oEvent) {\r\n    ...\r\n    this._<strong>oView<\/strong>.someFunction(...);\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n});<\/pre>\n<p>But sometimes the developer, averse to underscores, will write it like this:<\/p>\n<pre>sap.ui.controller(\"local.controller\", {\r\n\r\n  <strong>oView<\/strong> : null,\r\n \r\n  onInit : function() {\r\n    this.<strong>oView<\/strong> = this.getView();\r\n  },\r\n \r\n  onSomeEvent : function(oEvent) {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.<strong>oView<\/strong>.someFunction(...);\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n});<\/pre>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What actually happens is that the call to<\/p>\n<pre>this.<strong>oView<\/strong> = this.getView();<\/pre>\n<p>is clobbering the internal property oView of &#8216;this&#8217; (the controller), which is pointing at the view it&#8217;s related to. Luckily what it&#8217;s being clobbered with in this small (underscore-less) antipattern is another reference to the\u00a0view itself, so not much immediate harm done, but it&#8217;s not entirely safe or future proof.<\/p>\n<p>Another interesting best practice described in this section of the SDK relates to internationalisation (i18n). What one should do is to use placeholders (such as {0}) in more complete sentences in translateable resources. What one often finds is that application texts are fragmented into short phrases and built up with concatenation, along with variables.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that sentence structure varies across languages &#8211; as described in the &#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8221; example in this section, a typical example is where the verb goes.\u00a0It&#8217;s better to avoid programmatic text construction, and leave it to the translation experts.

The 3rd declension noun\u00a0[\u03c3\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1](https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/%CF%83%E1%BF%86%CE%BC%CE%B1)\u00a0conveys the idea of a mark, a sign, a token. It refers to \u201cmeaning\u201d, essentially, and the use in modern languages of the word semantic often implies an abstraction, a layer that confers or allows meaning to be defined or carried.\n\nWhat has that got to do with UI5 reaching release 1.30? Well, take a look at the fledgling [Semantic Page](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.semantic.SemanticPage\/samples). It\u2019s the root of a series of new controls that are perhaps set to encourage standardisation of Fiori UIs. The [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/) describe a rich set of controls, but more importantly they describe how those controls should be typically employed.\n\nFloorplans such as the [Split Screen Layout](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/floorplans\/split-screen\/) and the [Full Screen](http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/floorplans\/full-screen\/)\u00a0are all fairly familiar to us. But consistency comes from attention to a more granular level of detail, and the UI designers are encouraged to place certain controls in standard places. A couple of examples: Action buttons belong in the bottom right (in the footer) of a page, while\u00a0the new [Message\u00a0Popover](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.MessagePopover\/samples)\u00a0from 1.28 belongs in the bottom left.\n\nWhen SAP created Fiori application developer teams across the world to build out [the Fiori apps that we see available today](fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com\/sap\/fix\/externalViewer\/), it was almost inevitable that the different styles and approaches across teams and members would have resulted in a variety of structures, making it difficult to get the UX right, the UI consistent, and causing\u00a0maintenance headaches. So SAP created scaffolding (sap.ca.scfld), a set of mechanisms that abstracted away a lot of the common boilerplate stuff allowing the developers to focus on the application logic (and preventing them from reinventing the boilerplate, slightly differently, every time). But this scaffolding was a little bit too monolithic, and I think the plan has been to phase it out.\n\n[![Semantic Page Master-Detail](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.49.53-300x231.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.49.53.png)I\u2019m also thinking that the alternative could involve\u00a0this set of semantic controls. Take a look at the way the [Semantic Page Master-Detail sample](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPage\/preview)\u00a0puts things in the appropriate place \u2013 at a semantically meaningful level of abstraction above the individual mechanics of a Page control\u2019s aggregations, for example.\n\nIt\u2019s similar in the [Semantic Page Full Screen sample](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen\/preview) too. To get a feel for this level of abstraction, [take a look](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen\/code) at how the aggregations are filled \u2013 nowhere in this XML view definition does it say *where* the semantic controls should go:\n\n[![](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.57.35.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.57.35.png)\n\nWhat we seem to have so far is a small hierarchy of Page based controls, that looks like this:\n\n SemanticPage | +------------------------------+ | | MasterPage ShareMenuPage | +---------------+ | | DetailPage FullscreenPage\n\nAnd there are [plenty of semantic controls too](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/index.html#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.semantic.html).

The 3rd declension noun\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/%CF%83%E1%BF%86%CE%BC%CE%B1\">\u03c3\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1<\/a>\u00a0conveys the idea of a mark, a sign, a token. It refers to &#8220;meaning&#8221;, essentially, and the use in modern languages of the word semantic often implies an abstraction, a layer that confers or allows meaning to be defined or carried.<\/p>\n<p>What has that got to do with UI5 reaching release 1.30? Well, take a look at the fledgling <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.semantic.SemanticPage\/samples\">Semantic Page<\/a>. It&#8217;s the root of a series of new controls that are perhaps set to encourage standardisation of Fiori UIs. The <a href=\"http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/\">SAP Fiori Design Guidelines<\/a> describe a rich set of controls, but more importantly they describe how those controls should be typically employed.<\/p>\n<p>Floorplans such as the <a href=\"http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/floorplans\/split-screen\/\">Split Screen Layout<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/floorplans\/full-screen\/\">Full Screen<\/a>\u00a0are all fairly familiar to us. But consistency comes from attention to a more granular level of detail, and the UI designers are encouraged to place certain controls in standard places. A couple of examples: Action buttons belong in the bottom right (in the footer) of a page, while\u00a0the new <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.MessagePopover\/samples\">Message\u00a0Popover<\/a>\u00a0from 1.28 belongs in the bottom left.<\/p>\n<p>When SAP created Fiori application developer teams across the world to build out <a href=\"fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com\/sap\/fix\/externalViewer\/\">the Fiori apps that we see available today<\/a>, it was almost inevitable that the different styles and approaches across teams and members would have resulted in a variety of structures, making it difficult to get the UX right, the UI consistent, and causing\u00a0maintenance headaches. So SAP created scaffolding (sap.ca.scfld), a set of mechanisms that abstracted away a lot of the common boilerplate stuff allowing the developers to focus on the application logic (and preventing them from reinventing the boilerplate, slightly differently, every time). But this scaffolding was a little bit too monolithic, and I think the plan has been to phase it out.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.49.53.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2081 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.49.53-300x231.png\" alt=\"Semantic Page Master-Detail\" width=\"300\" height=\"231\" \/><\/a>I&#8217;m also thinking that the alternative could involve\u00a0this set of semantic controls. Take a look at the way the <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPage\/preview\">Semantic Page Master-Detail sample<\/a>\u00a0puts things in the appropriate place &#8211; at a semantically meaningful level of abstraction above the individual mechanics of a Page control&#8217;s aggregations, for example.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s similar in the <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen\/preview\">Semantic Page Full Screen sample<\/a> too. To get a feel for this level of abstraction, <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/sample\/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen\/code\">take a look<\/a> at how the aggregations are filled &#8211; nowhere in this XML view definition does it say *where* the semantic controls should go:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.57.35.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2084 \" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.57.35.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"605\" height=\"516\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>What we seem to have so far is a small hierarchy of Page based controls, that looks like this:<\/p>\n<pre>          SemanticPage\r\n               |\r\n     +------------------------------+\r\n     |                              |\r\n MasterPage                   ShareMenuPage\r\n                                    |\r\n                            +---------------+\r\n                            |               |\r\n                       DetailPage     FullscreenPage<\/pre>\n<p>And there are <a href=\"https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/index.html#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.semantic.html\">plenty of semantic controls too<\/a>.

This is not only annoying but in fact bad design as it means to mix static configuration in large amounts with actual code.\n\nOne way to solve this is the usage of a manifest file \u2013 one central asset that holds your entire application configuration. The UI5 creators have drawn inspiration from the W3C manifest for a web application concept that is currently under investigation and create an UI5 flavored version of it. The app descriptor in UI5 is basically a JSON\u00a0file named manifest.json that is expected in the same folder your component lives in. All you need to do to get started is to add an attribute manifest with the value \u201cjson\u201d to your component metadata.\n\nIntroduced in 1.28 in a basic version, with upcoming 1.30 it is even smarter. Beyond static configuration for packaging and deployment it even helps to save you some code, especially when it comes to model instantiation. The manifest itself is structured in namespaces of which we want to briefly look into sap.app and sap.ui5 for this case. More details and examples can be found in the [1.30 documentation preview.](https:\/\/openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html)\n\n**sap.app:**\n\nMostly app specific attributes can be found here. You can also get set for your data model and resource bundle here.

A full blown service configuration would look like this:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-07 at 19.51.14](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.51.14.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.51.14.png)\n\nIf you have more than one service you can simply add another object to this attribute. These can later be referenced by the given name. In addition we added the relative path to the i18n file here and will make use of this later as well.\n\n**sap.ui5:**\n\nThis namespace is used for any configuration that can be used by the UI5 runtime directly. This counts for the routing configuration, but also for UI5 library dependencies and of course our case with the model instantiation.\n\nFor i18n it is pretty straightforward and a named i18n resource model (named \u201ci18n\u201d) will be created by the UI5 runtime. For the actual data model(s) you can also\u00a0specify a name or keep it blank for an unnamed data model like this. Just set the datasource specified earlier and UI5 will handle the rest. The created models will be at your command as early as in the init function of your component.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-07 at 19.54.22](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.54.22.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.54.22.png)\n\nTo conclude this is only a snapshot of one little feature that is built into the new UI5 manifest, but showcases pretty well how this new file will ease your development routines, help to clean up your components and limit repetitive lines of code.\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Day 6\u00a0by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ThiloDev\">Thilo Seidel<\/a><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Writing your component based applications in UI5 you might be familiar with a long list of settings in your metadata section making you scroll down for hours before reaching the point where the first violin plays.

A full blown service configuration would look like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.51.14.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2103 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-07-at-19.51.14.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-07 at 19.51.14\" width=\"446\" height=\"243\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you have more than one service you can simply add another object to this attribute. These can later be referenced by the given name.

For the actual data model(s) you can also\u00a0specify a name or keep it blank for an unnamed data model like this. Just set the datasource specified earlier and UI5 will handle the rest.

In my particular case, that\u2019s most often my MacBook Pro running OSX, but sometimes a Debian-based environment running in a chroot on my Chromebook, courtesy of the awesome [crouton](https:\/\/github.com\/dnschneid\/crouton) project. I use tools that work for me, that don\u2019t get in the way of my flow, and at the bare essentials level, that means a\u00a0decent\u00a0editor (Vim or Atom), a local webserver (based on NodeJS), and a runtime platform that doubles as debugging, tracing and development (Chrome).\n\n**Cloud Environment**\n\nWhen I\u2019m working in the cloud, specifically with the SAP Web IDE, the toolset is totally different. Not only that, but the bootstrapping of UI5 works slightly differently. In this short post, I wanted to explain what I do to flatten any speedbumps when transitioning between the two environments. The worst thing for me would be to have to alter my codebase slightly to take account of different runtime environments.\n\n**Different UI5 Versions**\n\nLocally, I maintain a variety of different UI5 versions, that I\u2019ve picked up over the months and years. You never know when you\u2019ll need to go back to a previous version, or even look through the complete history, to see how something has changed. This is what the contents my local ~\/ui5\/ folder look like:\n\n\u00a0\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.37.15](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.37.15.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.37.15.png)\n\nI use the NodeJS-based static_server.js \u00a0script to serve files from this folder, as well as another folder which contains my UI5 projects. From here, I can access different UI5 versions by changing the location that the UI5 bootstrap looks. (Note that while I can and do often access older versions, I pretty much always develop against the latest version, unless there\u2019s a good reason not to \u2026 access to older versions is almost always for reference purposes.)\n\nUsually I specify \u201clatest\u201d in the URL, which refers to the symbolic link in the folder above, which (via the use of the small \u201csetlatest\u201d script) in turn points to whatever folder represents the latest unpacked zip:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.10.56](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.10.56.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.10.56.png)\n\nIf I want to refer to an older version, I do so like this:\n\n[![UI5 1.22.5](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.11.11.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.11.11.png)\n\nThe same approach with the URL path applies to the contents of the \u201csrc\u201d attribute in the UI5 bootstrap:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-12 at 08.50.35](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.35.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.35.png)\n\n**Harmonising Local and Cloud Bootrapping**\n\nHowever, this doesn\u2019t play well with the SAP Web IDE, at least not directly. So I\u2019ve come up with an approach that minimises the fuss and disruption when taking a UI5 app repo that I\u2019ve developed locally, and cloning it for use in the SAP Web IDE on the HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) environment, or vice versa.\n\nLet\u2019s look at an almost empty UI5 project folder that I\u2019ve created locally:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.22.18](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.22.18.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.22.18.png)\n\nIn it, we have the index.html which contains a UI5 bootstrap that looks like this:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-12 at 08.50.49](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.49.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.49.png)\n\nThe \u201csrc\u201d attribute refers to a resources folder in the same location as the containing index.html. The value of this attribute (\u201cresources\/sap-ui-core.js\u201d) is pretty much the de facto standard for \u201cthe location of the UI5 runtime\u201d, so it\u2019s sensible to change this only if you have a very good reason, if not only because you\u2019re starting a battle that you might not want to see through.\n\nIf you look at the folder listing above, you\u2019ll see that this resources folder is actually a symbolic link to the resources folder in the \u201clatest\u201d UI5 version, as described earlier (yes, so we have a symbolic link following a symbolic link).\u00a0So we\u2019re bootstrapping whatever the latest version of UI5 is.\n\nWe\u2019re not interested in having this in our UI5 application repo (it would be of no use in most other contexts) so in our .gitignore file, we exclude it:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.23.26](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.23.26.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.23.26.png)\n\nWhen we want to run the application in the HCP context, via SAP Web IDE, we use a mapping file that translates our bootstrap \u201csrc\u201d attribute URL into a resource that is available globally on HCP. This mapping file is neo-app.json, and here, it contains this:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.25.20](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.25.20.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.25.20.png)\n\nThe path \u201cresources\u201d is mapped to the target \u201csapui5\u2033 service at \u201c\/resources\u201d. This means that the script element in our index.html can successfully resolve and bootstrap UI5 from the right place, with zero changes between my local environment and HCP.\n\nWith my \u201cresources\u201d symbolic link in place, along with the neo-app.json mapping, I can enjoy\u00a0a smooth transition between local and cloud based development when I\u2019m working on UI5 development with the latest version. It\u2019s a simple technique; get it in place, and\u00a0you could be looking at some happy productivity gains, without loss of any reference to older UI5 versions locally.\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a><strong>\u00a0&#8211; Day 9\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.05.52.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2138 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.05.52.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.05.52\" width=\"153\" height=\"116\" \/><\/a>Like many developers who find themselves building a lot with UI5, I find my working environment is mostly a local one, supplemented by activities in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Local Environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>More precisely, while I often use the excellent <a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-55465\">SAP Web IDE<\/a>\u00a0&#8211; for training, generating starter projects and custom Fiori work, my main development workflow is based upon tools that are local to my workstation.

So I&#8217;ve come up with an approach that minimises the fuss and disruption when taking a UI5 app repo that I&#8217;ve developed locally, and cloning it for use in the SAP Web IDE on the HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) environment, or vice versa.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at an almost empty UI5 project folder that I&#8217;ve created locally:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.22.18.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2144 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.22.18.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.22.18\" width=\"714\" height=\"219\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In it, we have the index.html which contains a UI5 bootstrap that looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.49.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2155 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-12-at-08.50.49.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-12 at 08.50.49\" width=\"351\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;src&#8221; attribute refers to a resources folder in the same location as the containing index.html. The value of this attribute (&#8220;resources\/sap-ui-core.js&#8221;) is pretty much the de facto standard for &#8220;the location of the UI5 runtime&#8221;, so it&#8217;s sensible to change this only if you have a very good reason, if not only because you&#8217;re starting a battle that you might not want to see through.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at the folder listing above, you&#8217;ll see that this resources folder is actually a symbolic link to the resources folder in the &#8220;latest&#8221; UI5 version, as described earlier (yes, so we have a symbolic link following a symbolic link).\u00a0So we&#8217;re bootstrapping whatever the latest version of UI5 is.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re not interested in having this in our UI5 application repo (it would be of no use in most other contexts) so in our .gitignore file, we exclude it:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.23.26.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2145 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.23.26.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.23.26\" width=\"424\" height=\"76\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When we want to run the application in the HCP context, via SAP Web IDE, we use a mapping file that translates our bootstrap &#8220;src&#8221; attribute URL into a resource that is available globally on HCP. This mapping file is neo-app.json, and here, it contains this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.25.20.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2146 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-11-at-16.25.20.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-11 at 16.25.20\" width=\"477\" height=\"332\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The path &#8220;resources&#8221; is mapped to the target &#8220;sapui5&#8243; service at &#8220;\/resources&#8221;.

It&#8217;s a simple technique; get it in place, and\u00a0you could be looking at some happy productivity gains, without loss of any reference to older UI5 versions

Those of you who are familiar with SAP Fiori applications will probably already know what a Component preload file is, however those of you who aren\u2019t will almost definitely have all seen a reference to this file before. This file is referenced in an error message that appears in the console whenever you load a UI5 app, which is lacking a Component preload file.\n\n[![Chrome_preload_error](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-20.54.47-1024x51.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-14-at-20.54.47.png)\n\n**So just what is this preload file and why should I care?**\n\nThe preload file is essentially all of the files which make up your application, so that\u2019s the Component itself, Controllers, Views, Fragments and so on, all compressed and inserted into one file, the preload file. If this file exists then UI5 will only load that file, and it won\u2019t load of all of the other various files which it ordinarily would have done. The error we saw earlier is caused because UI5 looks for a preload file early in the execution flow, but of course did not find one, and so carried on loading all of the files individually.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve cleared up what the file actually is, and why that error appears, just why should exactly should we worry about it? After all we\u2019ve ignored that error up until now and all our apps have worked just fine. Well, the reason we should care is that it dramatically decreases page load time. This is due to the app only having to make one call to get the preload file, rather than all of the individual calls for each file, but also because in the preload file the code is \u201cminified\u201d, which means the file size is also very small relative to the full size individual files. This is especially important when developing UI5 applications which are to be used over a mobile data connection, where size has a very large impact on initial load performance. As an anecdotal example, on the simple UI5 app which I have just created a preload file for my initial load time went from 8-9 seconds down to 3-4 seconds, which is tremendous improvement!\n\n**Sounds great! So how can I make a preload file for my UI5 app?**\n\nFor this next section you will need to have installed on your machine [NodeJS](https:\/\/nodejs.org\/), [npm](https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/) and [Grunt](http:\/\/gruntjs.com\/). If you don\u2019t know how to install and use these things then do\u00a0[reach out to me on Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com\/johnbmurray).\n\nAfter you have all of the above installed, you\u2019ll need to create a `package.json` file in your UI5 app\u2019s root directory. Open the file up and paste in the contents below and don\u2019t forget to edit them accordingly:\n\n{ \"name\": \"barcode-test\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"description\": \"\", \"main\": \"index.html\", \"author\": \"John Murray\", \"license\": \"Apache License, Version 2.0\", \"devDependencies\": { \"grunt\": \"^0.4.5\" } }\n\nAfter creating and saving this file, install the [Grunt OpenUI5 tools](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/grunt-openui5)\u00a0which are made by the UI5 team at SAP. To install these tools open a terminal session in your UI5 root directory and run this command \u2018npm install grunt-openui5 \u2013save-dev\u2019. This will download and install the tools, and also add them to the \u201cdevDependencies\u201d section of your \u2018package.json\u2019 file.\n\nNext, again in the UI5 app root directory, create a file called \u2018Gruntfile.js\u2019. Into this file copy and paste the contents below, and we\u2019ll go through what it all means in a moment.\n\nmodule.exports = function(grunt) { \/\/ Project configuration. grunt.initConfig({ pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'), openui5_preload: { component: { options: { resources: { cwd: '', prefix: '', src: [ 'webapp\/**\/*.js', 'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.html', 'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.json', 'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.xml', 'webapp\/**\/*.view.html', 'webapp\/**\/*.view.json', 'webapp\/**\/*.view.xml', 'webapp\/**\/*.properties' ] }, dest: '', compress: true }, components: true } } }); grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-openui5'); }\n\nThis is quite a simple example but it will suffice in most use cases. What we are doing here first of all is reading in the \u2018package.json\u2019 file created earlier which provides the dependency list. Then we are setting the configuration options for \u2018openui5_preload\u2019 which is the specific tool we are going to be using from the OpenUI5 toolset.\n\n- The \u2018cwd\u2019 parameter allows you to provide a base directory for finding the files and the \u2018prefix\u2019 parameter lets you prefix all files with a path of your choosing; in this instance we are not using either of these parameters so we are leaving them blank.\n- The \u2018src\u2019 parameter lets you provide an array of paths, which it will use to try and match files in your directory and then for those matches it will minify and add them to the preload. I have all of my UI5 application files within a subdirectory called \u2018webapp\u2019 which is why my paths all begin with \u2018webapp\u2019. I have all my UI5 files located in this directory because I can then keep all of my other files and folders such as \u2018node_modules\u2019, PhoneGap config files, IDE folders, etc back in the root directory. I do this because it allows me to use this simple \u201cget everything\u201d approach you see above in the \u2018src\u2019 without worrying about accidentally including non-UI5 app files.\n- The \u2018dest\u2019 parameter specifies the path to the destination you wish to save the preload file. In this case we just want to save it in the same place as the `Component.js` file and therefore can leave it blank.\n- The \u2018compress\u2019 parameter sets whether or not you wish to minify the files as well as add them to the preload file. I would personally recommend always setting this to \u2018true\u2019 unless you have a good reason not to.\n- The \u2018components\u2019 parameter here with a value of \u2018true\u2019 sets the tool to automatically find all components and create a preload for each.\n\nFinally, we load the \u2018grunt-openui5\u2032\u00a0toolkit from the plugin as previously installed and specified in \u2018package.json\u2019.\n\n*For the full documentation and parameter list I\u2019d recommend looking at the\u00a0[Grunt OpenUI5 tools](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/grunt-openui5)\u00a0GitHub page.*\n\nThat\u2019s all the configuration set up, now it\u2019s time to generate our preload file! Fire up a terminal session in the same directory as your \u2018Gruntfile.js\u2019 and run the following command \u2018grunt openui5_preload\u2019 and you should see the following output along with a \u2018Component-preload.js\u2019 file alongside your \u2018Component.js\u2019 file.\n\n[![preload_generation_output](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-00.48.10-1024x144.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-15-at-00.48.10.png)\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve just made your first preload file and are now well on the way to creating even better apps with UI5!\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a>\u00a0&#8211;\u00a0Day 14\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/jmurray.me\/\">John Murray<\/a><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this\u00a0post\u00a0we&#8217;ll be looking at how you can speed up the load times of your UI5 applications by using a Component preload file.

Open the file up and paste in the contents below and don&#8217;t forget to edit them accordingly:<\/p>\n<pre>{\r\n  \"name\": \"barcode-test\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"description\": \"\",\r\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\r\n  \"author\": \"John Murray\",\r\n  \"license\": \"Apache License, Version 2.0\",\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"grunt\": \"^0.4.5\"\r\n   }\r\n }<\/pre>\n<p>After creating and saving this file, install the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/grunt-openui5\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt OpenUI5 tools<\/a>\u00a0which are made by the UI5 team at SAP. To install these tools open a terminal session in your UI5 root directory and run this command &#8216;npm install grunt-openui5 &#8211;save-dev&#8217;. This will download and install the tools, and also add them to the &#8220;devDependencies&#8221; section of your &#8216;package.json&#8217; file.<\/p>\n<p>Next, again in the UI5 app root directory, create a file called &#8216;Gruntfile.js&#8217;. Into this file copy and paste the contents below, and we&#8217;ll go through what it all means in a moment.<\/p>\n<pre>module.exports = function(grunt) {\r\n\r\n  \/\/ Project configuration.\r\n  grunt.initConfig({\r\n    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),\r\n    openui5_preload: {\r\n      component: {\r\n        options: {\r\n          resources: {\r\n            cwd: '',\r\n            prefix: '',\r\n            src: [\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.js',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.html',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.json',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.fragment.xml',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.view.html',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.view.json',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.view.xml',\r\n              'webapp\/**\/*.properties'\r\n            ]\r\n          },\r\n          dest: '',\r\n          compress: true\r\n        },\r\n        components: true\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-openui5');\r\n\r\n}<\/pre>\n<p>This is quite a simple example but it will suffice in most use cases. What we are doing here first of all is reading in the &#8216;package.json&#8217; file created earlier which provides the dependency list. Then we are setting the configuration options for &#8216;openui5_preload&#8217; which is the specific tool we are going to be using from the OpenUI5 toolset.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The &#8216;cwd&#8217; parameter allows you to provide a base directory for finding the files and the &#8216;prefix&#8217; parameter lets you prefix all files with a path of your choosing; in this instance we are not using either of these parameters so we are leaving them blank.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8216;src&#8217; parameter lets you provide an array of paths, which it will use to try and match files in your directory and then for those matches it will minify and add them to the preload. I have all of my UI5 application files within a subdirectory called &#8216;webapp&#8217; which is why my paths all begin with &#8216;webapp&#8217;. I have all my UI5 files located in this directory because I can then keep all of my other files and folders such as &#8216;node_modules&#8217;, PhoneGap config files, IDE folders, etc back in the root directory. I do this because it allows me to use this simple &#8220;get everything&#8221; approach you see above in the &#8216;src&#8217; without worrying about accidentally including non-UI5 app files.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8216;dest&#8217; parameter specifies the path to the destination you wish to save the preload file. In this case we just want to save it in the same place as the `Component.js` file and therefore can leave it blank.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8216;compress&#8217; parameter sets whether or not you wish to minify the files as well as add them to the preload file. I would personally recommend always setting this to &#8216;true&#8217; unless you have a good reason not to.<\/li>\n<li>The &#8216;components&#8217; parameter here with a value of &#8216;true&#8217; sets the tool to automatically find all components and create a preload for each.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, we load the &#8216;grunt-openui5&#8242;\u00a0toolkit from the plugin as previously installed and specified in &#8216;package.json&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p><em>For the full documentation and parameter list I&#8217;d recommend looking at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/grunt-openui5\" target=\"_blank\">Grunt OpenUI5 tools<\/a>\u00a0GitHub page.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all the configuration set up, now it&#8217;s time to generate our preload file!

There are so many factors to get right. Debugging one of these apps can be just as tough.\n\nThe UI5 toolkit supports many features that make building and debugging easier. One of these is the support for the separation of concerns in the form of Model-View-Controller (MVC) mechanisms. Another is the ability to use a declarative approach to define your views (no moving parts), in XML, HTML or JSON; furthermore, you can use the subview and fragment concepts to divide and conquer complexity and embrace reuse.\n\n**The Support Tool**\n\nThe particular feature I wanted to talk briefly about in this post though is the Support Tool, alternatively known as \u201cUI5 [Diagnostics](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/6ec18e80b0ce47f290bc2645b0cc86e6.html)\u201c, or even \u201cthe claw hand thing\u201d. This last nickname comes from the fact that you invoke the support tool from a challenging key combination: Ctrl-Alt-Shift-S.\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-07-18 at 12.15.31](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.15.31-300x227.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.15.31.png)There\u2019s also the Support Tool\u2019s little brother, invoked with Ctrl-Alt-Shift-P, which is a model popup giving you a summary of the runtime context, and giving you the chance to turn on some debugging information.\n\nYou can see a shot of this on the left. (You can also turn on debugging via a URL query parameter [sap-ui-debug=true](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/c9b0f8cca852443f9b8d3bf8ba5626ab.html).)\n\nSometimes this is all you need, especially if you want to see the UI5 version in operation, or turn on debug sources.\n\nBut the Support Tool is a super, multi-faceted mechanism which has proved invaluable over the years. It sports a large number of\u00a0features, too many to cover here, so we\u2019ll just have a brief look at one of them (arguably the most important) \u2013 the Control Tree:\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-07-18 at 12.23.12](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.23.12.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.23.12.png)\n\nOn the left hand side there\u2019s a super useful display of the app\u2019s control hierarchy. This alone is worth the cost ([ahem](http:\/\/openui5.org\/)) of the Support Tool.\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-07-18 at 12.39.15](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.39.15-150x150.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.39.15.png)Imagine being able to peer into the internal structure of a building, or having [X-Ray Specs](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-Ray_Spex)\u00a0and being able to see your skeleton, or sitting in front of a monitor in The Matrix and seeing the world behind the curtain. This is what you get with the Control Tree.\n\nUI5 apps can have complex UI structures. Fiori apps especially so. Controls within controls, [wheels within wheels in a spiral array, a pattern so grand and complex](http:\/\/www.azlyrics.com\/lyrics\/rush\/naturalscience.html). \u00a0With the Control Tree you can see and grok this structure very quickly. Note you can view\u00a0at a glance what the control actually is, what it contains & what contains it, and what its ID is.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. On the right hand side, for a selected control (for example the Page control in the screenshot above), you can see all the properties of that control and from where in the control inheritance they come. You can modify the values for those properties and see the effect immediately, and even set breakpoints for each time the value for a particular property is read (G \u2013 get) or written (S \u2013 set).\n\nSelect the Binding Infos tab and see what bindings exist. You can see information on what model a binding is from, what type of binding it is, and of course the binding path. Here we can see some of the binding info for the List control in an app:\n\n[![Screenshot 2015-07-18 at 12.50.26](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.50.26.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screenshot-2015-07-18-at-12.50.26.png)\n\nFor you\u00a0eagle-eyed readers, the model name here \u2014 \u201centity\u201d \u2014 is the name of the domain model in this app example. Often the domain model is the unnamed model, but here it has a name. Can anyone guess what this (publically available) app is?\n\nThere\u2019s so much to discover\u00a0with the Control Tree and the rest of the Support Tool, I recommend you hit Ctrl-Alt-Shift-S the next time you\u2019re running a\u00a0UI5\u00a0apps, and start exploring.\n\n**Finishing off**\n\nLet\u2019s finish this post off with a quick piece of trivia and a tip. If you\u2019ve had the Chrome Developer Tools open and then open the Support Tool, you\u2019ll notice a ton of new messages in the console, and it\u2019s a lot more verbose. This is because when the Support Tool starts up, it sends a message to the [logger](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/jQuery.sap.log.html) to crank the logging output [up to 11](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Up_to_eleven).\n\nBy default, the log level is set to 1 (\u201cERROR\u201d). If you\u2019re running the app with debugging on, that level is 4 (\u201cDEBUG\u201d). But opening the Support Tool causes this to be set to 6 (\u201cALL\u201d). You can turn that down again with the jQuery.sap.log.setLevel function.

At the other, they\u2019re the subject of many a passionate debate, second perhaps only to the Vim vs Emacs [editor wars](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Editor_war).\n\nI\u2019ll provide some caution by starting with one of my favourite quotes from Andrew Tanenbaum:\u00a0*\u201cThe nice thing about standards is that there are so many of them to choose from\u201d.*\n\n**Use of standards**\n\nAs software projects scale up, coding standards make more and more sense. On a [recent run](https:\/\/www.endomondo.com\/users\/1074038\/workouts\/555294655), I listened to the\u00a0JavaScript Jabber podcast \u201c[JSJ ESLint with Jamund Ferguson](http:\/\/devchat.tv\/js-jabber\/162-jsj-eslint-with-jamund-ferguson)\u201c. There was a great discussion about ESLint, and it was interesting to see the different perspectives on imposed coding standards, from \u201cit restricts my freedom of expression\u201d to \u201cit makes teams more efficient as they work more as one\u201d. I think those two perspectives slot roughly onto the scale spectrum. If it\u2019s just you developing, then by all means use whatever style you feel like using. But if you\u2019re part of a larger team whose members have to work with each other\u2019s code, imposed coding standards do make a lot of sense.\n\nThe OpenUI5 project has some coding [contribution\u00a0guidelines](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/master\/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribute-code)\u00a0as well as [ESLint rules](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/master\/.eslintrc), well worth checking out, and pretty important if you want to contribute to UI5. It\u2019s also worth considering them for your own UI5 applications. One advantage of adopting the OpenUI5 project\u2019s guidelines and rules is that when you cross the path from your codebase into the underlying UI5 toolkit, the transition won\u2019t be as jarring.\n\n**Example XML View**\n\nThe ESLint rules, and ESLint in general would cause this post to be a lot longer than I want, so instead I\u2019ll look at some non-JavaScript conventions that I like to try and impose, at least upon myself. In particular I\u2019ll look at the style for XML View definitions. Here\u2019s part a sample XML View, which I\u2019ll use to illustrate the style for which I strive. Note that the \u201c\u00bb\u201d character represents a tab (I have the list mode turned on in my editor to [show invisibles](http:\/\/vimcasts.org\/episodes\/show-invisibles\/)).\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-19 at 09.40.55](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-09.40.55.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-09.40.55.png)\n\nIn the following, each prefix represents the line number(s) to which I\u2019m referring.\n\n**1**: The correct namespace for a\u00a0[View](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.core.mvc.View.html) is \u201csap.ui.core.mvc\u201d, not \u201csap.ui.core\u201d as you might have seen in older documentation and code examples.\n\n**2**: The controllerName attribute should be the first attribute for the View element. If there is no controller then obviously this attribute won\u2019t be present. It just makes it slightly quicker to look for the controller reference if it\u2019s going to be consistently in the same place.\n\n**3-5**: All the namespace declarations should be in a contiguous chunk. There are other attributes that might appear for a View element, that\u2019s fine, as long as they\u2019re not interspersed amongst the namespace declarations. Ensure any other attributes appear before the namespace declarations. Also, don\u2019t specify a namespace declaration unless you\u2019re going to use it. (In this example, I\u2019m using all of them; you just can\u2019t see the use of the \u201ccore\u201d here as it\u2019s on line 60, not in the screenshot).\n\n**5**: The default XML namespace for any given XML View should be the one that is dominant in the file, or \u201csap.m\u201d. If you\u2019re building responsive UI5 apps, you\u2019re going to need a good reason for \u201csap.m\u201d\u00a0*not* to be the dominant library. Also, it should be the last attribute in the View element, with a closing angle bracket directly following. (Unlike the use of other angle-bracket powered markup (such as HTML) in UI5, this is a rule that can be applied consistently. With the UI5 bootstrap in HTML, I like to have the closing angle bracket on a separate line, in the \u2018prefix-comma\u2019 style from ABAP and other code, so I can add further data attributes without causing diff confusion.)\n\n**1-5, 6-7, 11-13 etc**: All attributes should appear on lines of their own, indented appropriately.\n\n**13**: When closing an element directly (like this: <element \/> rather than this: <element>\u2026<\/element>), a space should be used before the closing \u201c\/>\u201d.\n\n**8, 17, 22, 29, etc**: All aggregation elements should be used explicitly. Don\u2019t omit implicit default aggregations for controls; instead, specify them. In this example, I\u2019m using a sap.m.Page control, with the \u201csubHeader\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d aggregations. While the \u201csubHeader\u201d aggregation must be specified explicitly anyway, the \u201ccontent\u201d aggregation is default and doesn\u2019t need to be, but I do anyway. The same goes for the sap.m.List control\u2019s \u201citems\u201d aggregation.\n\n**18**: Contrary to the rule about attributes being on their own separate lines, there\u2019s an exception to this which is for the id attribute. If it exists, put it on the same line as the opening part of the control\u2019s element.\n\n**25**: Unless there\u2019s a good reason not to, create the names for your event handler functions using an \u201con\u201d prefix (like here: \u201conSelect\u201d). This way they\u2019re consistent with the builtin view lifecycle event functions such as \u201conInit\u201d.\n\n**31-34**: When writing complex embedded binding syntax, put each property of the map on a separate line, in the same way you\u2019d write a map in JavaScript. Use spaces before and after the colons.\n\n**1-34**:\u00a0Use double quotes throughout; the only place you\u2019ll then use single quotes is within embedded binding syntax.\u00a0Also \u2026\u00a0I know this is the subject of much debate, but\u00a0the\u00a0OpenUI5\u2019s project standard specifies tabs for indentation. It came as a shock to me at first, but I have now embraced it :-)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI have no doubt caused some outrage to some of you, but hopefully just as much agreement with others. For me, this sample XML View is easy to read, a lot easier than some of the Fiori views that are generated from templates, for example. What are your standards?\n\n\n","html":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-07.09.23.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2244 \" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-07.09.23.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-19 at 07.09.23\" width=\"190\" height=\"142\" \/><\/a><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a> &#8211; Day 16 by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At one end of the spectrum, coding standards can be regarded as <a href=\"https:\/\/jaxenter.com\/power-ten-nasas-coding-commandments-114124.html\">essential<\/a>.

There was a great discussion about ESLint, and it was interesting to see the different perspectives on imposed coding standards, from &#8220;it restricts my freedom of expression&#8221; to &#8220;it makes teams more efficient as they work more as one&#8221;. I think those two perspectives slot roughly onto the scale spectrum. If it&#8217;s just you developing, then by all means use whatever style you feel like using. But if you&#8217;re part of a larger team whose members have to work with each other&#8217;s code, imposed coding standards do make a lot of sense.<\/p>\n<p>The OpenUI5 project has some coding <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/master\/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribute-code\">contribution\u00a0guidelines<\/a>\u00a0as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/master\/.eslintrc\">ESLint rules<\/a>, well worth checking out, and pretty important if you want to contribute to UI5.

The logical place\u00a0for models, views and controllers\u00a0are files, in (usually) separate folders. Views, with specific file extensions, in a folder that\u2019s usually called \u201cviews\u201d, and controllers, with specific file extensions, in a folder called \u201ccontrollers\u201d. And models elsewhere too.\n\nThis means that if you\u2019re wanting to try something out quickly, and it\u2019s a little bit more than a Hello World construction, then you\u2019re off creating files and folders from the start before you can properly start thinking about the actual app idea you want to explore.\n\nThat is, unless you use a \u201cMinimum Viable Code\u201d technique. I like to think that it\u2019s due to a\u00a0combination of the three great virtues of a programmer ([laziness, impatience and hubris](http:\/\/c2.com\/cgi\/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris)) that led to this\u00a0approach :-).\n\nCreating a folder structure and getting the right files in place does not go well with the \u201cquickly\u201d part of \u201ctry something out quickly\u201d. Trying something out, for me, means ideally using just a single file. It\u2019s fast, you can see everything in one place, and you\u2019re not creating unnecessary clutter. But when I want to try something out also, I also want to ensure\u00a0that the code I write is clean and separated. Which for me implies declarative views and fragments in XML.\n\nLuckily, for nearly\u00a0all of the cases where I\u2019ve wanted to try something out, I\u2019ve found that this single file technique works well. I can have one or more views, and fragments, all declared in XML, and one or more controllers too. And within that space I can declare models too.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n\n- I start out with a skeletal index.html with a UI5 bootstrap already there, and the\u00a0HTML\u00a0body element defined properly\n- I add a simple triple (or [tripel](http:\/\/www.beeradvocate.com\/beer\/style\/58\/)) \u00a0of : view, corresponding controller, and what I call \u2018startup code\u2019\n- I can then add controls to the view, functions to the controller, and off I go\n- I use jQuery to identify the XML views and fragments, and construct the view instances in UI5 that way\n\nAnd here\u2019s an example:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-19 at 18.09.27](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-18.09.27.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-19-at-18.09.27.png)\n\nHere\u2019s a brief rundown of what you see:\n\n**9-16**: This is the UI5 bootstrap, nothing unusual here\n\n**18-28**: Here we have a script element that is of a made-up type \u201cui5\/xmlview\u201d. This could be pretty much anything, as long as the browser doesn\u2019t try to process it. It\u2019s a technique used in templating systems. This contains some XML, which as you can see is a small but perfectly formed view definition (which incidentally conforms to the [UI5 Coding Standards explained in a previous post](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/ui5-and-coding-standards\/) in this series.\n\n**31-36**: This is the local controller definition, which is referenced in the View\u2019s controllerName attribute (in line 20). It has the onPress handler for the Button\u2019s press event.\n\n**38-40**: This is the startup code. It instantiates the XML View, getting the value for the viewContent property via jQuery from the script element we saw earlier, and then simply places that View in the body, via the \u201ccontent\u201d ID, as usual.\n\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much it. You can add as many views as you want using the script element technique; I also use this technique for fragments too, and specify a made-up type of \u201cui5\/xmlfragment\u201d instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to write simple one-file applications, especially for prototyping. I have written snippets to help me with this. I have been somewhat fickle when it comes to editors, so have left a trail of semi-finished snippet libraries for Sublime ([SublimeUI5](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/SublimeUI5)) and Atom ([ui5-snippets](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/ui5-snippets)), but have finally come full circle to my first love, vim.

In particular we looked at the Properties and Binding Infos tabs. While exploring the new UI5 1.30 features with the Explored app, I re-noticed a small addition to the Explored UI \u2013 a Button that allowed me to switch to full screen mode to view control samples.\n\n[![fullscreentoggle](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/fullscreentoggle.gif)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/fullscreentoggle.gif)\n\nI thought it would be fun to use the Support Tool and other debugging techniques to see what was exactly happening in the Explored app when we toggled that control.\n\n**Identifying the Button**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the Button control \u2013 by its ID. We can use a context menu feature of Chrome which will open up the Developer Tools: Right-click on the Button and select Inspect Element. This will show us the ID in the highlighted sections in the screenshot:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 09.13.22](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.13.22-1024x540.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.13.22.png)\n\nHere, the full ID highlighted is \u201c__xmlview2\u2013toggleFullScreenBtn-img\u201d, as we right clicked on the image part of the Button. Go up a couple of levels in the HTML element hierarchy and you\u2019ll see the <button> with an ID without the \u201c-img\u201d suffix. That\u2019s what we want.\n\n**Stopping at the Press Event**\n\nWe could at this stage [play an instant](http:\/\/mtg.wikia.com\/wiki\/Instant) and use sap.ui.getCore().byId to get a handle on the control with this ID. But instead let\u2019s look at the Support Tool and how it can expose event breakpoints.\n\nOpening the Support Tool, and the Control Tree section within, we can search for the ID \u201c__xmlview2\u2013toggleFullScreenBtn\u201d. When we find it, we can switch to the Breakpoints tab and set a breakpoint for the firePress function (as that is what will be happening when we press the Button \u2013 a \u201cpress\u201d event will be fired):\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 09.18.35](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.18.35-1024x361.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.18.35.png)\n\nNow when we press the Button, we land inside Breakpoint.js:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 09.22.29](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.22.29-1024x540.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.22.29.png)\n\n**Finding the Event Handler**\n\nNow that we\u2019re here, there\u2019s plenty to explore, but let\u2019s cut to the chase and look at the Button instance. In particular, we\u2019ll look at an internal property \u201cmEventRegistry\u201d which is a map that holds the functions to be called when specific events are fired. Remember that this is an internal property, which we can\u2019t use, or rely upon, when *building* apps (for more details on this, see the post \u201c[JavaScript Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts in UI5](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/javascript-dos-and-donts-for-ui5\/)\u201d in this series). But we\u2019re not building, we\u2019re debugging, so all bets are off.\n\nThe \u2018this\u2019 here is the Button control instance, and so we can see that the \u201cthis.mEventRegistry\u201d map has an entry for \u201cpress\u201d:\n\nthis.mEventRegistry -> **Object {press: Array[1]}**\n\nLooking at this single entry in the array for the \u201cpress\u201d event, we can see that the function handler is in a controller (surprise surprise):\n\nthis.mEventRegistry[\"press\"][0].fFunction -> **sap.ui.controller.onToggleFullScreen(oEvt)**\n\nUnless you\u2019re using an older version of Chrome, you should be able to click on the function name to bring you to the \u201conToggleFullScreen\u201d function definition:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 09.29.55](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.29.55-1024x365.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.29.55.png)\n\nNice!\n\n**Examining What Happens**\n\nWe can now put a breakpoint on line 163 (which I had done already before taking the screenshot above) and hit continue, to be able to then step into what this function calls (the updateMode function) when the stack gets here. This is what the updateMode function looks like:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-20 at 09.34.58](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.34.58-1024x388.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-20-at-09.34.58.png)\n\nIt sets the Split App\u2019s [mode](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.SplitAppMode.html) to the appropriate value (the default of \u201cShowHideMode\u201d, or \u201cHideMode\u201d for the full screen effect). It also modifies the containing [Shell](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.Shell.html#getAppWidthLimited) control\u2019s appWidthLimited property so that a real full screen effect can be properly achieved.\n\nSo that\u2019s it! If you can become comfortable helping yourself with these tools, you\u2019ll be a better UI5 developer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a> &#8211; Day 19 by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In an earlier post in this <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/category\/30ui5\/\">series<\/a>, entitled &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/the-ui5-support-tool-help-yourself\/\">The UI5 Support Tool &#8211; Help Yourself!<\/a>&#8220;, we looked at the Support Tool, examining the information available in the Control Tree.

Creating a message resource bundle in your `Component.js` file is straightforward, especially if picking up the user\u2019s language preferences in the browser.\n\nWhat can be less straightforward though is organising these files into something manageable, for plenty of projects, your i18n file might be on the small side, but it\u2019s pretty easy to build up a large file. An application I\u2019m currently working on, which perhaps has only 50% of its views defined, already has just 100 definitions in the i18n file. (A quick look at the Fiori My Travel Expenses App v2 shows there are around 1000 lines, and about 500 definitions in the resource file and whilst reasonably well documented with comments \u2013 you may well be hunting for usage of a text).\n\n```\n#XBUT,20: Button that distributes (shares) the total amount evenly between all attendees<br><\/br>\nDISTRIBUTE_EVENLY=Distribute Amounts Evenly```\n\n#XBUT,20: add internal attendee button  \n ADD_INTERNAL_ATTENDEE=Add Internal Attendee\n\n#XBUT,20: add external attendee button  \n ADD_EXTERNAL_ATTENDEE=Add External Attendee\n\n#XFLD,20: FirstName \u2013 LastName in the right order, e.g. EN: Smith, John  \n ATTENDEE_FULLNAME_ARTIFACT={1}, {0}\n\n#XTIT: title of Add Internal Attendees select dialog  \n INTERNAL_ATTENDEES_TIT=Add Internal Attendees\n\n#XTIT: title of Add External Attendees dialog  \n EXTERNAL_ATTENDEES_TIT=Add External Attendees\n\n*Example of a Fiori Resource Model file from \u2018My Travel Expenses\u2019*\n\nBefore we dive into the structure of the key value pairs of the file though, it\u2019s worth thinking about if one file for all your texts makes sense. In the majority of cases, you really wouldn\u2019t want to add further complexity by adding more files. in my experience though, there are some cases where creating additional resource files may be useful.\n\n- You may have texts which are more prone to change, perhaps email \/ telephone contact details in messages; putting these into a separate file might make sense to de-risk the process of updating them when they need to change\n- Common elements across a suite of applications\n- Master data texts, if you have a lot of these, then consider separate files for them\n- You may have texts, or elements of texts which don\u2019t need translation, and you want to keep consistent across all languages (that email example above, you don\u2019t want to update that in multiple language files every time)\n- Lastly just like code \u2013 if it\u2019s too long, break it up. Large app with 100\u2019s if not 1000\u2019s of terms? Split it up, maybe by view, or group of views.\n\nAs we move on into the structure of these files, it might not seem to be important (you can always search for a term in your chosen IDE after all), but like all good coding practices, structure can be immensely helpful in the following regards\n\n- Identifying gaps in language files becomes easier \u2013 so you don\u2019t discover in the first round of translation that you had some texts hardcoded into your XML views\n- Making changes to texts, when a change is requested becomes a lot easier\n- When sending out for translation, identifying which text is which becomes easier\n- Because the file can be more easily understood, then it becomes an easier artefact to distribute, potentially removing the need for conversion back and forth between spreadsheets\n\nHow you choose to organise the language file is a matter of preference, however in my experience there are two key things I like to highlight and organise in the language file:\n\n- Common terms\n- Terms organised by\u00a0View or Fragment \/ Control \/ Property\n\nI\u2019ll define all the common terms at the beginning of my language file. My preference for all my keys, is to use a dot notation to specify them (as it lines up nicely with identification of components). So here\u2019s an example\n\n```\n#Common Terms<br><\/br>\ncommon.thing=Foo<br><\/br>\ncommon.items=Items<br><\/br>\ncommon.add=Add<br><\/br>\n\u2026<br><\/br>```\n\nThing is though, common terms feel like something I should have in my application; you want to make sure that when you call a thing, `Foo` it\u2019s always a `Foo` and when it\u2019s requested to change to `Bar` I can change the common term, and my job is done. In practice though, this never really works.\u00a0Why? Well I might be able to define those common terms, but in the majority of cases I always need to fit them into a longer text, such as `Create a Foo` or `Delete Foos`.\n\nOK so maybe I can define some common texts, and do some clever pre-processing with Grunt to expand placeholders in my text, or do the same when I load the resource file\n\n```\n#Specifc Terms (pre-process)<br><\/br>\nmaster.things.addThing=Add {common.thing}<br><\/br>\nmaster.things.deleteThings=Delete {common.thing}s<br><\/br>```\n\n```\n#Specific Terms (post-process)<br><\/br>\nmaster.things.addThing=Add Foo<br><\/br>\nmaster.things.deleteThings=Delete Foos<br><\/br>```\n\nNice?\u00a0Well not really, it\u2019s not a great practice to make longer texts out of shorter texts. Consider\u00a0the need to correctly handle plurals or other modifications you might require. Let\u2019s say we can have `Foos` but it\u2019s not `Bars` but `Baren` then my nice easy change above isn\u2019t going to work. Then other languages might not have the same syntactic structures, and I could finish up chasing my tail trying to get it right across all languages, or finishing up like those pre-recorded train announcements made up of single recorded chunks \u2013 they work, but just sound awful.\n\nThere is one valid place for common terms, and you might therefore still want to define them in your main i18n file (or even a separate one you don\u2019t load). That\u2019s as a glossary to help those maintaining the file. Adding `common.thing=Foo` to the head of the file, even if never used will help those coming along after to understand how things are referred to. It\u2019s a good UX practice, and fundamental to building a consistent experience.\n\nSo most of my definitions though, will be very specific to a view or fragment, and therefore, I like to identify these, in this manner, with the application as an implied root. If I\u2019m developing a Split App, which has for example the following views\n\n- Tasks (Master)\n- Services (Master)\n- Rounds (Detail)\n- Details (Fragment used in Rounds)\n\nthen I\u2019ll structure my language file, very specifically to reference the view, the control(s) in the view, and where appropriate the property. Which might result in something like.\n\n```\n#Master views<br><\/br>\n#Tasks<br><\/br>\nmaster.tasks.title=Maintenance Tasks<br><\/br>\n#Services<br><\/br>\nmaster.services.title=Active Services<br><\/br>\nmaster.services.toolbar.button.add=Add Service<br><\/br>\nmaster.services.toolbar.button.delete=Delete Services<br><\/br>\n#Detail Views<br><\/br>\n#Rounds<br><\/br>\ndetail.rounds.title=Round Definition<br><\/br>\ndetail.rounds.tabBar.tab.details=Details<br><\/br>\ndetail.rounds.tabBar.tab.vehicles=Vehicles<br><\/br>\n#Rounds \/ Vehicles fragment<br><\/br>\ndetail.rounds.fragment.vehicles.column.title.service=Service<br><\/br>\ndetail.rounds.fragment.vehicles.column.title.capacity=Capacity<br><\/br>\n\u2026```\n\nAdmittedly this is quite a verbose approach, and it requires a little discipline to use, but the advantages are plain to see \u2013 I immediately get a sense of where a text might appear in the user interface, I also can get a sense of if anything is missing (for example I\u2019d expect every view to have a `{view}.title` attribute.\n\nBy taking a structured approach to the language file, it also makes it easier to set up controls with bindings to the language file, as there is no need to try and think of a name. It goes without saying that you should be building your xml views with bindings for texts from the very start of development \u2013 no one wants to go back and to add them all in at a later date (if you do, that\u2019s precious velocity you\u2019re wasting).\n\nWho thought such a straightforward flat structured concept could require so many considerations?\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a> \u2013 Day 23 by <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/lxinspc\">Nathan Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>UI5\u2019s support for multiple-languages, out of the box (see the post &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/multi-language-support-out-of-the-box-ui5s-pedigree\/\">Multi-language support out of the box &#8211; UI5&#8217;s pedigree<\/a>&#8221; in this series) is impressive and easy to use.

Especially to those who have written large numbers of controllers thus far, for example. The way the XML View\u2019s Controller is defined is \u2026 different. Step 5 doesn\u2019t say much specifically about how this works, but Step 6, on \u201cModules\u201d, does.\n\nThis is what the Controller source code looks like:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-27 at 10.13.53](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-10.13.53.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-10.13.53.png)\n\nSo what\u2019s happening here?\n\nWell, what\u2019s happening is that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of a migration to an Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) style mechanism. And the principle vehicle for this is a new function sap.ui.define, which was introduced to the world in 1.28 (1.27 internally).\n\nThere\u2019s already some\u00a0API documentation for this experimental new way to define modules that you can read in the API reference guide for sap.ui.define itself. There you\u2019ll see how there\u2019s a transition planned away from synchronous, and towards asynchronous loading. You\u2019ll see for example that the optional fourth parameter \u201cbExport\u201d of sap.ui.define is there to support that transition.\n\nWhile there\u2019s plenty to read there, let\u2019s just take a quick look at what it means for those like us at the UI5 coalface. We\u2019ll take the code in the screenshot above as an example:\n\nInstead of calling something like this \u2026\n\nsap.ui.core.mvc.Controller.extend(\"your.name.here\", { \u00a0\/\/ your controller logic here });\n\n\u2026 we can use the new more generic sap.ui.define to first of all declare dependencies and then define the factory function that becomes the controller, in this case. Let\u2019s take a look at the code and examine it line by line:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-27 at 10.42.52](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-10.42.52-1024x457.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-10.42.52.png)\n\n**1-14**: The call to sap.ui.define extends across all the lines here; and we can see that out of the four total possible parameters described in the API reference, only two are used: the optional list of dependencies (represented here by the array) and the factory function that has a single statement returning an extended controller.\n\n**2-3**: These are the dependencies. We\u2019re defining a Controller, so we\u2019ll want to extend UI5\u2019s core controller (in the same way that we often do, such as in the example earlier). For that, we have a dependency on sap.ui.core.mvc.Controller. We\u2019re also using the Message Toast\u2019s \u201cshow\u201d function, so we declare a dependency on sap.m.MessageToast. Note that the dependencies are expressed as resource paths (with the .js suffix omitted of course).\n\n**4**: The second parameter passed in the call to sap.ui.define is the factory, and we can see the function definition start here. Note that each dependency reference is given to this factory function, in the same order that they\u2019re declared in the dependency list. By convention, the most significant part of the resource path name is used for the parameter name (for example \u201cController\u201d for sap.ui.more.mvc.Controller).\n\n**5**: The call to \u201cuse strict\u201d is not specifically a feature of the new module definition syntax, but it is significant in that there is growing focus on JavaScript syntax correctness and linting. For more on this, see another post in this series: \u201c[UI5 and Coding Standards](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/ui5-and-coding-standards\/)\u201c.\n\n**7-12**: The rest of the source code looks fairly familiar. There\u2019s one exception though, and it\u2019s a result of the dependency mechanism described earlier. The function has \u201cController\u201d and \u201cMessageToast\u201d available to it, and so we can and should use these to refer to the sap.ui.core.mvc.Controller and sap.m.MessageToast resources throughout. This is nice, and makes for slightly neater code too.\n\nIt\u2019s early days for the new define mechanism, and there\u2019s clearly a journey ahead for those in the core UI5 team looking after fundamental module and dependency loading and management mechanisms. But even at this early stage, it\u2019s worth paying attention to the direction UI5 is going in this regard, and start to experiment. I know I will be!\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-11.04.02.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2349 \" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-27-at-11.04.02-300x207.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-27 at 11.04.02\" width=\"239\" height=\"165\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5 <\/a>-\u00a0Day 24\u00a0by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve followed <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">this series<\/a> you&#8217;ll have come across the <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/openui5-walkthrough\/\">OpenUI5 Walkthrough<\/a>, a &#8220;a great multi-step walkthrough of many of the features and practices of UI5 development&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In Step 5 of the walkthrough, on &#8220;Controllers&#8221;, we&#8217;re introduced to something that looks unfamiliar.

In [the blog post that accompanied it](http:\/\/openui5.tumblr.com\/post\/113243652527\/new-openui5-preview-release-1-28), a number of the new features were introduced.\u00a0Without much fanfare, certainly without any cool looking screenshots, the experimental \u201cClient\u201d operation mode was announced for the OData Model mechanism.\n\n**OData Model \u2013 Server-side**\n\nThe OData Model is special, in that it is [classified](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/e1b625940c104b558e52f47afe5ddb4f.html) as a server-side model, unlike its client-side siblings such as the JSON Model or the XML Model (or the Resource Model, for that matter). This means that the data \u201chome\u201d is seen as the server, rather than the client (the browser). Consequently, any operations on that data, even read-only operations such as sorting and filtering, take place on the server. That means extra network calls. [There are truly marvellous advantages also, which the margin [of this post] is too narrow to contain.\u00a0](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem#Fermat.27s_conjecture)\n\nThere are circumstances, even when dealing with entity sets in OData services, where sorting and filtering could and should take place on the client, rather than on the server. To this end, 1.28 brought an initial experimental feature to the OData Model mechanism \u2013 the [OData Operation Mode](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.model.odata.OperationMode.html).\n\n**Operation Mode**\n\nThe Operation Mode joins a small but important set of modes relating to the OData Model mechanism. By default, the Operation Mode is \u201cServer\u201d. But it can be set to \u201cClient\u201d, which causes all data to be loaded from the server and for subsequent sorting and filtering operations to be performed in the client, without further network calls. As the blog post mentions, this only really makes sense as long as there isn\u2019t a ton of data.\n\nNote that the Operation Mode is related to the OData Model mechanism instantiation in that it is the *default* for that model instance. You actually specify the mode for a binding, as shown in the code snippet\u00a0in the blog post:\n\noTable.bindRows({ \u00a0 path: \"\/Product_Sales_for_1997\", \u00a0 parameters: { \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0operationMode: sap.ui.model.odata.OperationMode.Client \u00a0 } });\n\n**Experiment!**\n\nThis experimental feature was crying out for \u2026 well, experimentation. So I threw together an MVC ([model view controller, minimum viable code](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/mvc-model-view-controller-minimum-viable-code\/)) based app to test it out. Here\u2019s the result:\n\n[![clientoperationmode](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/clientoperationmode.gif)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/clientoperationmode.gif)\n\nHere we have a test app with a List, where the items aggregation is bound to the Categories entity set in the public Northwind OData service at [http:\/\/services.odata.org\/V2\/Northwind\/Northwind.svc\/](http:\/\/services.odata.org\/V2\/Northwind\/Northwind.svc\/).\n\nNote that the Operation Mode is only available on [the v2 version of the OData Model mechanism](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel.html#constructor), so that\u2019s what I\u2019m using here.\n\nInitially the binding to the List\u2019s items aggregation is with the (default) value of \u201cServer\u201d for the Operation Mode. You can see the network calls that are made to ask the OData service to return the entities in a specific order (with the $orderby OData parameter) each time I hit the sort button, which is toggling between ascending and descending sorting of the category names.\n\nBut then, in the console, I grab the List, and re-bind the items aggregation, to the same path (\u201c\/Categories\u201d) but in \u201cClient\u201d Operation Mode.\u00a0The result is that a new call is made to fetch the entities to satisfy that (new) binding, but further sorts are done entirely on the client \u2013 there are no more network calls made.\n\nI\u2019d call that experiment a success, and I\u2019m looking forward to developments in this area. Nice work, UI5 team!\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-28-at-12.53.45.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2361\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-28-at-12.53.45-300x191.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-28 at 12.53.45\" width=\"171\" height=\"109\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5 <\/a>-\u00a0Day 25 by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A few months ago a preview release of 1.28 was made available.

You can see the network calls that are made to ask the OData service to return the entities in a specific order (with the $orderby OData parameter) each time I hit the sort button, which is toggling between ascending and descending sorting of the category names.<\/p>\n<p>But then, in the console, I grab the List, and re-bind the items aggregation, to the same path (&#8220;\/Categories&#8221;) but in &#8220;Client&#8221; Operation Mode.\u00a0The result is that a new call is made to fetch the entities to satisfy that (new) binding, but further sorts are done entirely on the client &#8211; there are no more network calls made.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d call that experiment a success, and I&#8217;m looking forward to developments in this area. Nice work, UI5 team!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 12:07:22 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 12:07:22 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 12:07:22 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":2365,"title":"UI5 - looking back and forward","slug":"ui5-looking-back-and-forward","markdown":"\n**[![Screen Shot 2015-07-29 at 07.33.30](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-29-at-07.33.30-300x122.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-29-at-07.33.30.png) [30 Days of UI5 ](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/)-\u00a0Day 26 by [DJ Adams](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/)**\n\nIt was in the spring of 2012 when I wrote this piece about\u00a0the new kid on the block, SAPUI5:\n\n[SAPUI5 \u2013 The Future direction of SAP UI Development?](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/insights\/blog\/sap_ui_5_the_future_direction_of_sap_ui_development\/)\n\nThe fledgling toolkit had been released at version 1.2 earlier that year, and while it had\u00a0clearly been in gestation for a while inside SAP, it was still new and raw enough to make folks wonder what it was all about.

Shortly after, the [announcement](https:\/\/twitter.com\/OpenUI5\/status\/626658243071315968) was also made that this would also be available for OpenUI5.\n\nThis is great news, and something that we\u2019ve been waiting for now for a while. It makes perfect sense, and the ability to select a particular runtime version via a part of the bootstrap URL\u2019s path info is very nice. It\u2019s something I do locally on my workstation anyway, and I also have a \u2018latest\u2019 symbolic link that I ensure points to the latest copy of the runtime or SDK that I have locally.\n\nAlong with the announcement came a link to a simple [SAPUI5 Version Overview](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/versionoverview.html) page, built in UI5. It looks like this:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-31 at 13.11.42](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.11.42-1024x542.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.11.42.png)And if you look under the covers, you\u2019ll see a single-file app, with a lot of custom CSS, some JavaScript view stuff going on, and the retrieval of a couple of JSON resources containing the [version overview info](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/versionoverview.json)\u00a0and the data from the [neo-app.json](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/neo-app.json) file that is present in the HCP platform and which describes routes to destinations, which include the SAPUI5 runtime services, now available at different paths for different versions.\n\nYou\u2019ll also see some [complex manipulation and merging of those two datasets](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/ui5versioninfo\/blob\/master\/versionoverview.html#L207-L263), and [the mix of UI5 controls with raw HTML header elements](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/ui5versioninfo\/blob\/master\/versionoverview.html#L298-L308).\n\n[![Screen Shot 2015-07-31 at 13.22.44](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.22.44-169x300.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.22.44.png)The result is an app that looks OK on the desktop but doesn\u2019t look that well on a smartphone, as you can see on the right.\n\nSo I spent some time on the train down from Manchester to London early this morning to see what I could do.\n\nI wanted to address a couple of things:\n\n- have the smartphone as the target device, rebuilding the UI with an App control\n- improve the binding, to a single data collection\n\nThe UI part was straightforward. I used my MVC technique (see [MVC \u2013 Model View Controller, Minimum Viable Code](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/mvc-model-view-controller-minimum-viable-code\/) from earlier in this series) to define a new View, declaratively in XML. I used an App control with a couple of Pages, and a simple controller for the view which handled all the view lifecycle and user-generated events, as well as being the container for the formatter functions.\n\nI also used some of my favourite JavaScript functions to bind together the disparate data into a nice cohesive single array of maps.

It makes perfect sense, and the ability to select a particular runtime version via a part of the bootstrap URL&#8217;s path info is very nice. It&#8217;s something I do locally on my workstation anyway, and I also have a &#8216;latest&#8217; symbolic link that I ensure points to the latest copy of the runtime or SDK that I have locally.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the announcement came a link to a simple <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/versionoverview.html\">SAPUI5 Version Overview<\/a> page, built in UI5. It looks like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.11.42.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2390 size-large\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.11.42-1024x542.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-31 at 13.11.42\" width=\"625\" height=\"330\" \/><\/a>And if you look under the covers, you&#8217;ll see a single-file app, with a lot of custom CSS, some JavaScript view stuff going on, and the retrieval of a couple of JSON resources containing the <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/versionoverview.json\">version overview info<\/a>\u00a0and the data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/neo-app.json\">neo-app.json<\/a> file that is present in the HCP platform and which describes routes to destinations, which include the SAPUI5 runtime services, now available at different paths for different versions.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also see some <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/ui5versioninfo\/blob\/master\/versionoverview.html#L207-L263\">complex manipulation and merging of those two datasets<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/ui5versioninfo\/blob\/master\/versionoverview.html#L298-L308\">the mix of UI5 controls with raw HTML header elements<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.22.44.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2391 \" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-13.22.44-169x300.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-07-31 at 13.22.44\" width=\"153\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a>The result is an app that looks OK on the desktop but doesn&#8217;t look that well on a smartphone, as you can see on the right.<\/p>\n<p>So I spent some time on the train down from Manchester to London early this morning to see what I could do.<\/p>\n<p>I wanted to address a couple of things:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>have the smartphone as the target device, rebuilding the UI with an App control<\/li>\n<li>improve the binding, to a single data collection<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The UI part was straightforward.

I used an App control with a couple of Pages, and a simple controller for the view which handled all the view lifecycle and user-generated events, as well as being the container for the formatter functions.<\/p>\n<p>I also used some of my favourite JavaScript functions to bind together the disparate data into a nice cohesive single array of maps.

In my \u201c[Re-presenting my site with SAPUI5](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wZUXz5f1CHI)\u201d video [I used an XML Model to load the XML feed](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/sapui5bin\/blob\/master\/blogui\/resources\/blogarchive.controller.js#L9-L10) of my weblog into a UI5 app (gosh, [JavaScript views](https:\/\/github.com\/qmacro\/sapui5bin\/tree\/master\/blogui\/resources)!).\n\nThe XML Model mechanism proved very useful this week on a project, and I thought I\u2019d re-examine some of its features. Everyone knows about the JSON and OData Model mechanisms; at least in my UI5 conversations, I don\u2019t hear folks talk about the XML Model much. So I thought I\u2019d give it some love here.\n\nThe [API reference documentation for the XML Model](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel.html)\u00a0is a little dry. As Frank Zappa once said, \u201c*The computer can\u2019t tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what\u2019s missing is the eyebrows*\u201c. We need to look elsewhere for the emotional story, for the eyebrows; and I think a nice place might be the [QUnit tests for\u00a0the XML Model](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/test-resources\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html).\n\n**Learning from the QUnit sources**\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the source, and see what we can learn. There are actually a couple of QUnit test files; we\u2019ll have a look at just one\u00a0of them \u2013 [XMLModel.qunit.html](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html). We\u2019ll just examine the setup and a couple of tests\u00a0to see what we can find \u2013 what we can expect to be able to do with an XML Model. You can explore the rest of the QUnit test files on your own.\n\nAt the start of XMLModel.qunit.html, [a couple of XML Models are instantiated with some test data](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L31-L46) as follows:\n\n var testdata = \"<teamMembers>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Andreas\\\" lastName=\\\"Klark\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Peter\\\" lastName=\\\"Miller\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Gina\\\" lastName=\\\"Rush\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Steave\\\" lastName=\\\"Ander\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Michael\\\" lastName=\\\"Spring\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Marc\\\" lastName=\\\"Green\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<member firstName=\\\"Frank\\\" lastName=\\\"Wallace\\\"><\/member>\" + \"<\/teamMembers>\"; var testdataChild = \"<pets>\" + \"<pet type=\\\"ape\\\" age=\\\"1\\\"><\/pet>\" + \"<pet type=\\\"bird\\\" age=\\\"2\\\"><\/pet>\" + \"<pet type=\\\"cat\\\" age=\\\"3\\\"><\/pet>\" + \"<pet type=\\\"fish\\\" age=\\\"4\\\"><\/pet>\" + \"<pet type=\\\"dog\\\" age=\\\"5\\\"><\/pet>\" + \"<\/pets>\";\n\n**setXML and setData**\n\nThe [XML data is added to the XML Models](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L48-L53)\u00a0with the setXML function:\n\n var oModel = new sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel(); oModel.setXML(testdata); sap.ui.getCore().setModel(oModel); var oModelChild = new sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel(); oModelChild.setXML(testdataChild);\n\nThis is different to the setData function, which is also present on the JSON Model, with an equivalent semantic. Here in the XML Model, the [setData](https:\/\/openui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel.html#setData) function\u00a0would be expecting an **XML encoded data object**, not a literal string containing XML.\n\nAs an example, if we have a variable containing some XML string like this:\n\nxmlstring = \"<root><name>DJ<\/name><\/root>\"\n\nthen we could either set it on an\u00a0XML Model with setXML, like this:\n\nm = new sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel() => sap.ui.d\u2026e.C.e\u2026d.constructor {mEventRegistry: Object, mMessages: Object, id: \"id-1438428838337-6\", oData: Object, bDestroyed: false\u2026} **m.setXML(xmlstring)** => undefined m.getProperty(\"\/name\") => \"DJ\"\n\nor with setData, creating an XML encoded data object, like this:\n\nm = new sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel() => sap.ui.d\u2026e.C.e\u2026d.constructor {mEventRegistry: Object, mMessages: Object, id: \"id-1438428927599-7\", oData: Object, bDestroyed: false\u2026} **m.setData(new DOMParser().parseFromString(xmlstring, \"text\/xml\"))** => undefined m.getProperty(\"\/name\") => \"DJ\"\n\n**A couple of tests**\n\nThen we\u2019re off on the tests. There\u00a0are [a couple of tests to check getProperty](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L61-L71), the first using a relative context binding:\n\n test(\"test model getProperty with context\", function(){ var oContext = oModel.createBindingContext(\"\/member\/6\"); var value = oModel.getProperty(\"@lastName\", oContext); \/\/ relative path when using context equal(value, \"Wallace\", \"model value\"); }); test(\"test model getProperty\", function(){ var value = oModel.getProperty(\"\/member\/6\/@lastName\"); equal(value, \"Wallace\", \"model value\"); });\n\nWhat we can see here already is that we can access XML attribute values (\u201clastName\u201d in this case) with the XPath @ accessor. As an aside, the use of the optional second oContext parameter in the getProperty call is something one doesn\u2019t see very much, but is extremely useful.\n\n**Element content retrieval**\n\nThe rest of the file contain a load of other tests, all useful reading material, from the rare-to-see [use of the unbindProperty](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L83) function\u00a0to [aggregation bindings that are comfortable to use](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L174-L195).\n\nOne thing that we have to wait until [test 15](https:\/\/github.com\/SAP\/openui5\/blob\/48324c5fd9ed365620bc49b32c4046aa76269bc7\/src\/sap.ui.core\/test\/sap\/ui\/core\/qunit\/XMLModel.qunit.html#L197-L211) to see is the use of element content:\n\n test(\"test XMLModel XML constructor\", function(){ var testModel = new sap.ui.model.xml.XMLModel( ); testModel.setXML(\"<root>\" + \"<foo>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.<\/foo>\" + \"<bar>ABCDEFG<\/bar>\" + \"<baz>52<\/baz>\" + \"<\/root>\"); equal(testModel.getProperty(\"\/foo\"), \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"); equal(testModel.getProperty(\"\/bar\"), \"ABCDEFG\"); equal(testModel.getProperty(\"\/baz\"), 52); });\n\nUntil now we\u2019ve only seen examples of XML where the data is stored in attributes. What about the more classic case of text nodes, like this example XML here?\n\nWell, as we can see, a simple call to getProperty will do what we want. If we\u2019re XPath inclined, we could even add the text() specification like this:\n\ntestModel.getProperty(\"\/bar\/text()\") => \"ABCDEFG\"\n\nand still get what we expect.\n\n**Ending where we started**\n\nAnd of course, to round things off, we can always get back to an **XML encoded data object** with getObject, like this:\n\ntestModel.getObject(\"\/bar\") => <bar>ABCDEFG<\/bar>\n\n(that result is indeed an object), in a similar way to how we retrieve the whole object from the model:\n\ntestModel.getData() => #document <root> <foo>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.<\/foo> <bar>ABCDEFG<\/bar> <baz>52<\/baz> <\/root>\n\nThe XML Model is a powerful ally, and the QUnit tests are a rich source of information about it. Spend a coffee break looking through the sources, you won\u2019t be disappointed!\n\n\n","html":"<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-11.56.50.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2401 \" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-01-at-11.56.50-300x213.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-08-01 at 11.56.50\" width=\"231\" height=\"164\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5 <\/a>-\u00a0Day 29 by <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/\">DJ Adams<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been more than a couple of years since I first had a look at XML data in the context of UI5.

It\u2019s packed in many ways: so much to share, so much to learn, so many people to meet and re-meet, so many kilometres to walk in the convention centre, and so much coffee.\n\nI\u2019m involved in a number of activities during the event. I\u2019m co-presenting a number of hands-on sessions relating to SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) and the SAP Web IDE, Fiori, and of course the fantastic UI5 toolkit. Here\u2019s a quick summary (in my own words):\n\n[**UX260 Experience SAP Fiori on SAP HANA Cloud Platform**](https:\/\/sessioncatalog.sapevents.com\/go\/agendabuilder.sessions\/?l=112&sid=26128&locale=en_US)  \n SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) is changing the Fiori landscape in so many ways, by offering features and services all the way from development, through connectivity & deployment, to exposure to end users. This session gives you hands-on experience at the places where Fiori and HCP meet.\n\n[**UX261 Extend a Fiori App with SAP Web IDE based on beautiful Fiori Reference Apps**](https:\/\/sessioncatalog.sapevents.com\/go\/agendabuilder.sessions\/?l=112&sid=26248&locale=en_US)  \n The key to the present and future success of Fiori in your organisation is the correct adoption of best practices, both from a general development perspective and also from an extension perspective (for standard SAP delivered Fiori apps). There\u2019s a lot to get wrong, but a ton of help for you to get it right.

So here goes with Week 1.\n\n**Week 1 \u2013 Get to Know SAP Fiori UX**\n\nA gentle start to the content this week, with a balance of marketing (you knew it was going to come, best to get it over with in the first week) and a 30,000 feet view of the UX strategy. If you\u2019ve followed the SAP Fiori UX revolution at all, it should all be fairly familiar to you. We also covered the SAP HANA Cloud Platform (HCP) and the key\u00a0role it plays in the extension concept generally, and in particular for Fiori apps.\n\nWithin the context of HCP\u00a0and the cloud centric approach we looked at various tools that are available for different stages in the Fiori app journey, from discovery (Splash), through design (Build) to development (WebIDE). There was also mention of the Rapid Development Solution (RDS) available, and the wealth of documentation that was to be had.\n\nWe\u00a0looked at SAP Fiori in the cloud, with a specific focus on Fiori-as-a-Service (FaaS) and the HANA Cloud Portal, where you can build sites including Launchpad-specific landing pages.\n\nFinally the focus ended upon S\/4HANA and how Fiori UX fits directly as the strategic way forward. Now I think it\u2019s fair to say that the statement \u201cSAP Fiori is the default user experience for S\/4HANA\u201d, but\u00a0If I\u2019m not mistaken, one of the lecturers\u00a0gave the impression that it\u2019s the *only* user experience. Yep, here, in Week 01 Unit 06:\n\n*\u201cWe provide Fiori, and Fiori is the\u00a0default user experience for S\/4HANA.\u00a0There\u2019s no other user experience there.We\u2019re not using SAP GUI, we\u2019re barely using any other user experience like NetWeaver business client.\u201d*\n\nNow, that\u2019s not quite true, is it? S\/4HANA, architecturally, is still based upon an ABAP Stack system, which means the venerable R\/3 architecture is still in play. Yes of course we have HANA underneath and Fiori on top, but in the middle we still have DISP+WORK and all the wonderful SAPGUI and ABAP goodness that we know and love. And while there are huge inroads made already in the new Simplified suite, there\u2019s always SAPGUI.\n\nI\u2019ll just put that down to the lecturer\u2019s excitement and enthusiasm :-)\n\nOverall, it was worth the hour or three invested in watching the videos**. And the assignment at the end of this week was pretty straightforward, as long as you were prepared for translating marketing speak into specific questions.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with one thought, which we may well pick up in week 2. Here\u2019s a screenshot, from one of the slides of an S\/4HANA Fiori app:\n\n[![](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-04-at-16.29.35.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-04-at-16.29.35.png)\n\nIn relation to the Fiori 2.0 designs, which are being introduced in week 2, there were some [comments on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/fredverheul\/status\/705489908769619968) today about the perceived complexity of the newer apps. I think we\u2019re already seeing complexity here, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the end of the world. Some things **do** require you to see more information.

Yes, Fiori 2.0 is still conceptual in parts, but we\u2019re already seeing practical output, in the form of the very real [Overview Page](https:\/\/sapui5.netweaver.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/c64ef8c6c65d4effbfd512e9c9aa5044.html) mechanism, for example. There are plenty of new concepts for Fiori in the 2.0 design, such as the Viewport, the Control Space and the Copilot.\n\nSome of these concepts are not new, but they don\u2019t have to be; in fact one of the key tenets of Design Thinking, introduced in Unit 2, is \u201cBuild on the ideas of others\u201d. I rather think that some of the ideas have been taken from the Dashboard concept that Nat Friedman built a good while ago \u2013 I [wrote a few posts on Dashboard](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/?s=dashboard)\u00a0back in 2003 and then later that decade.\n\n**Unit 2**\u00a0**\u201cIntroduction to Design Thinking\u201d**. This content isn\u2019t new, in fact the openSAP folks stated that it\u2019s the same content as last year\u2019s course. Nevertheless it was worth a brief re-introduction to set the scene for the design principles that are to come in Unit 3. The thing with Design Thinking, at least for me, is that it\u2019s all pretty obvious in theory, but putting it into practice requires effort.\n\nI think the concepts around the pre-build phases of app delivery still need to be successfully and firmly landed in some organisations. Further, there\u2019s a fine balance to be had between not letting technology (and developers) drive solutions, and designing something that would require a great deal of effort to implement. We have the tools (and the design principles) and know how to use them, so we should use that knowledge to inform the process.\n\n**Unit 3 \u201cThe SAP Fiori Design Guidelines\u201d**. Anyone who\u2019s looked into SAP Fiori UX is likely to be at least lightly acquainted with these, either at 30000 feet \u2013 with the 5 principles (Role-Based, Responsive, Simple, Coherent and Delightful)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or at ground level with the practical\u00a0[implementation advice in the online documentation](https:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/). But as this course is soon to introduce the first hands-on element (designing an app), it\u2019s valid to re-introduce them at this stage, if not to set a level knowledge playing field for all participants.\n\nI did like the explicit calling out of the concept of \u201cFiori-like\u201d towards the end of this unit. Design is not black and white, and there\u2019s been a long-standing question over whether non-SAP folks could call their apps \u201cFiori\u201d, or whether they had to say \u201cFiori-like\u201d. I\u2019ve maintained the position that if the design guidelines were followed, then they were \u201cFiori\u201d, not just \u201cFiori-like\u201d. That said, with the title of the course we put together gave in the early days (three years ago!) \u2013 \u201c[Building SAP Fiori-like UIs with SAPUI5](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/developer-center\/front-end\/blog\/2013\/10\/06\/building-sap-fiori-like-uis-with-sapui5)\u201c, things weren\u2019t so clear-cut :-)\n\n**Unit 4 \u201cSAP Fiori Decomposition and Recomposition\u201d**. You might be forgiven for thinking that this process is a somewhat over-formalisation of what appears to be straightforward:\u00a0The extraction of functionality from the \u201ckitchen-sink\u201d transaction-based approach of the traditional SAP experience into smaller role and task focused applications, sometimes combining functionality from previously separate transactions. Sure, that\u2019s what it is.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that, I think, when seen as a complete process. The functionality being extracted is predominantly being extracted from a proprietary context, and reconstituted into a neutral, platform-independent and responsive context. We\u2019ve been stuck too long in the world of proprietary, tethered too much to the desktop with SAP because of the Microsoft disease that has set hold in enterprises in the last couple of decades or more. So SAP targets that market and the only real experience for many has been SAPGUI for Windows, an experience that is so far from being portable it became one of the catalysts for Fiori. Recomposing functionality into the context of the one true native platform \u2013 the Web, is a great move for SAP.\n\n**Unit 5 \u201cThe Importance of Prototyping\u201d.**\u00a0Like Design Thinking but perhaps less so, prototyping phases are sometimes difficult to bring about and get the most out of, especially when deadlines and budgets are tight. Organisations need to work out the value for themselves for the Discover and Design phases, rather than just focus on the Develop and Deploy phases \u2026 especially those that involve the business.\n\n[![](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-07-at-07.48.08.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-07-at-07.48.08.png)\n\nThere\u2019s a leap of faith that\u2019s required, and we\u2019re all responsible for helping make\u00a0that happen.\n\nOn mockups and protoyping, especially in the early stages, I\u2019m a fan of the simplest thing that could possibly work, which is pencil and paper. Low cost, discardable, and folks aren\u2019t distracted by debating what colour a button should be.\n\nMoving into the benefits of the later stages of prototyping, I\u2019m reminded of one of the founding beliefs of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) \u2013 one of the bodies that maintain standards that mean that we can all simply take the Internet and all its children (such as the Web) for granted. This belief is \u201cgeneral consensus and running code\u201d ([from the Tao of IETF](https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/tao.html#rfc.section.2)). Showing a working model of something you\u2019re trying to convey is very valuable indeed.\n\n(I did take issue with the stated \u201ccorrect\u201d answer to one of the self-test questions on this unit: Q \u201cHow can app implementation be inexpensive?\u201d \u00a0A: \u201cIf enough iteration, prototyping and validation is done beforehand\u201d. That might mean the UX is right, but it doesn\u2019t imply that making that UX happen is easy!)\n\n**Unit 6 \u201cPrototyping 101 Using SAP Splash and Build\u201d**. Following on from my comments earlier about adoption and landing of the Discover and Design phases, this unit contained an overview of the two tools that help to support those stages \u2013 Splash and Build respectively. It\u2019s a longer than usual unit with 25 mins of video, but worth watching if you haven\u2019t already seen or played with these tools.\n\nThe tools themselves are already very accomplished, but I do wonder how much the studies have actually been employed thus far. It\u2019s partially a circular situation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the tools won\u2019t be used unless Discover and Design are more strongly adopted, and the adoption\u00a0has a better chance of taking hold if tools like this deliver on their promise.\n\nOne of the things that caught me eye (that hadn\u2019t been available in the early-access I\u2019d had to Splash a while ago) is the [Gallery](https:\/\/www.experiencesplash.com\/splashapp\/gallery)\u00a0of existing designs. I\u2019m looking forward to browsing through, and seeing how they complement the Fiori Design Guidelines.\n\n**Unit 7 \u201cDesign Challenge\u201d**. The last unit of this week sees the start of the first of the two practical portions of this course. This is the design challenge, where we must put into practice what we\u2019ve learned this week \u2013 covering the Discovery and Design phases of the end to end process, including use of Splash and Build. Giving and receiving feedback from course peers is also involved, which is a nice way to scale this, and also an opportunity for me to see feedback stats in these tools that has come from someone other than me!\n\nThis design challenge lasts two weeks, which means that although there\u2019s an assignment to complete this week, there isn\u2019t one next week \u2013 so that we have time to complete the first part of the challenge (submitting the design mockups) without needing to spend more time than budgeted for this course. A nice move.\n\n\u2014\n\nThere\u2019s one more aspect of this course that I wanted to mention last time but didn\u2019t get round to it. At the end of each week, there\u2019s a \u201cjust in time\u201d video blog entry which gives the course creators and instructors a chance to impart last minute information and changes. I like this aspect, and the relaxed nature of how it\u2019s presented. Indeed, with the contents of this course being based on software-as-a-service products in the cloud, and with the changes that happen on a monthly basis, it\u2019s a good idea.\n\nAnd on this note of constant change, I\u2019ll leave you with one thought from Martin Fowler. I was reminded of this wisdom via [Sascha Wenninger\u2019s tweet this morning](https:\/\/twitter.com\/sufw\/status\/707105718403371008): \u201cIf it\u00a0hurts, do it more often\u201d :-)\n\n(For links to commentary for further weeks, see the first post in this series:\u00a0[\u201cfiux2\u2033 \u2013 The openSAP Fiori Course \u2013 2016 Edition](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-the-opensap-fiori-course-2016-edition\/).)\n\n\n","html":"<p>Well, the weeks certainly come around fast in these <a href=\"http:\/\/open.sap.com\">openSAP<\/a> courses, and so we find ourselves on Week 2 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/fiux2\">Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud &#8211; 2016 Edition<\/a>.

Week 3 of the [Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud \u2013 2016 Edition](http:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/fiux2)\u00a0course has just come to a close, so it\u2019s time for me to write down my thoughts.\n\nThis week\u2019s content was shorter than usual. Deliberately so, to give the attendees a better chance at completing the Design Challenge, which started in Unit 7 of Week 2 (see my comments for that unit in [the previous post in this series](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-week-2-design-your-first-sap-fiori-app\/)). There were only three units, so let\u2019s have a look at those first, and then finish with a few observations on the Design Challenge.\n\n**Unit 1 \u201cAnatomy of SAP Fiori Apps\u201d.**\u00a0I enjoyed this unit very much, as it really started to explain well how the rubber hits the road. At some stage, UX needs to turn into UI and become real. Using a combination of\u00a0the excellent [SAP Fiori Design Guidelines](https:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/) and the actual controls in the UI5 toolkit itself (see [the Explored app](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html) for a great showcase of many of them)\u00a0\u2013 advice and building blocks in harmony \u2013 is a great way to get started on your Fiori app development journey.\n\nUnderstanding the anatomy of a Fiori app \u2013 from\u00a0small controls such as Buttons\u00a0to larger concepts such as the floorplans, and everything in between, can make the difference between creating a Fiori app, and a Fiori-like app. Here, I refer to Fiori-like as using the building blocks, but not in the right way.\n\n**Unit 2\u00a0\u201cIntroduction to SAPUI5 and OData\u201d.\u00a0**At less than 10 mins long, this unit was very short indeed, only providing a very high level introduction to two of the most important topics in Fiori \u2013 UI5 and OData. One of the aspects of the openSAP courses I\u2019ve become used to was the way the instructors often\u00a0squeezed as much out of each slide\u2019s content as possible. In this unit, I felt a lot of the detail was skipped.\n\nThat said, if it hadn\u2019t have been skipped, I could imagine the unit being four times as long or more. There is more on OData coming later in this course, so let\u2019s hope that they dig in a little more. OData is a fascinating topic,\u00a0not least because it\u2019s REST-informed, based on an architectural style that I [worked](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true) [hard](https:\/\/scn.sap.com\/people\/dj.adams\/blog\/2004\/06\/24\/forget-soap--build-real-web-services-with-the-icf) in the past trying to convince SAP of its merits :-)\n\n[![](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-23.00.42.png)](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true)\n\n*An old post on SCN from 2004 \u2013 \u201c[Real Web Services with REST and ICF](http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true)\u201d \u2013 where I expounded on the virtues of the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) based approach to data services \u2026 and was slightly disowned by SAP ;-)*\n\n**Unit 3 \u201cIntroduction to Annotations and Smart Templates\u201d.\u00a0**This was a very interesting unit, not least because of the implications and the reasoning behind augmenting the metadata with extra semantics. I\u2019ve written about semantic information before (see [Semantic Pages](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/semantic-pages\/), a post in the [30 Days of UI5](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/) series). This time it\u2019s about adding extra information to the OData metadata to enable a more rapid construction \u2013 in some cases automatic \u2013 of UI5 based application components. A control, or set of controls, that can understand the data that is bound to it, is capable of more than acting passively.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot driving the concept of annotations and their use in smart controls and templates, not least SAP\u2019s need to produce yet more SAP Fiori apps, more quickly and more reliably. Finding a way for apps, or parts of apps, to write themselves, is going to help that process.\n\nOne thing that made me smile was the lovely conflict between Unit 2\u2019s statement \u201c*OData model is based on \u2026 JSON*\u201d and Unit 3\u2019s statement \u201c*OData is based on XML*\u201c.\n\nOf course, we all know that it\u2019s based on both. JSON and XML just happen to be used to provide the format for the payload \u2013 there are different formats that the OData standard describes. But OData is also a protocol. Don\u2019t let this confusion confuse you \u2013 OData is about more than representing data, it\u2019s about describing operations upon that data too. The XML representation originates\u00a0from the Atom Syndication Format ([RFC4287](http:\/\/www.rfc-base.org\/rfc-4287.html)) \u2013 this informs the \u201cformat\u201d part of OData. The operations originate from the Atom Publishing Protocol ([RFC5023](http:\/\/www.rfc-base.org\/rfc-5023.html)) \u2013 this informs the \u201cprotocol\u201d part of OData.\n\n**Design Challenge**\n\nAnd what of the Design Challenge? First, the deadline has just been extended by a week due to some system problems that were encountered.

Week 3 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/fiux2\">Build Your Own SAP Fiori App in the Cloud \u2013 2016 Edition<\/a>\u00a0course has just come to a close, so it&#8217;s time for me to write down my thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>This week&#8217;s content was shorter than usual. Deliberately so, to give the attendees a better chance at completing the Design Challenge, which started in Unit 7 of Week 2 (see my comments for that unit in <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-week-2-design-your-first-sap-fiori-app\/\">the previous post in this series<\/a>). There were only three units, so let&#8217;s have a look at those first, and then finish with a few observations on the Design Challenge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 1 &#8220;Anatomy of SAP Fiori Apps&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0I enjoyed this unit very much, as it really started to explain well how the rubber hits the road. At some stage, UX needs to turn into UI and become real. Using a combination of\u00a0the excellent <a href=\"https:\/\/experience.sap.com\/fiori-design\/\">SAP Fiori Design Guidelines<\/a> and the actual controls in the UI5 toolkit itself (see <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html\">the Explored app<\/a> for a great showcase of many of them)\u00a0&#8211; advice and building blocks in harmony &#8211; is a great way to get started on your Fiori app development journey.<\/p>\n<p>Understanding the anatomy of a Fiori app &#8211; from\u00a0small controls such as Buttons\u00a0to larger concepts such as the floorplans, and everything in between, can make the difference between creating a Fiori app, and a Fiori-like app. Here, I refer to Fiori-like as using the building blocks, but not in the right way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 2\u00a0&#8220;Introduction to SAPUI5 and OData&#8221;.\u00a0<\/strong>At less than 10 mins long, this unit was very short indeed, only providing a very high level introduction to two of the most important topics in Fiori &#8211; UI5 and OData. One of the aspects of the openSAP courses I&#8217;ve become used to was the way the instructors often\u00a0squeezed as much out of each slide&#8217;s content as possible. In this unit, I felt a lot of the detail was skipped.<\/p>\n<p>That said, if it hadn&#8217;t have been skipped, I could imagine the unit being four times as long or more. There is more on OData coming later in this course, so let&#8217;s hope that they dig in a little more. OData is a fascinating topic,\u00a0not least because it&#8217;s REST-informed, based on an architectural style that I <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true\">worked<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/scn.sap.com\/people\/dj.adams\/blog\/2004\/06\/24\/forget-soap--build-real-web-services-with-the-icf\">hard<\/a> in the past trying to convince SAP of its merits :-)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2470\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-23.00.42.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1466\" height=\"640\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>An old post on SCN from 2004 &#8211; &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sdn.sap.com\/irj\/scn\/go\/portal\/prtroot\/docs\/library\/uuid\/ea8db790-0201-0010-af98-de15b6c1ee1a?overridelayout=true\">Real Web Services with REST and ICF<\/a>&#8221; &#8211; where I expounded on the virtues of the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) based approach to data services &#8230; and was slightly disowned by SAP ;-)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 3 &#8220;Introduction to Annotations and Smart Templates&#8221;.\u00a0<\/strong>This was a very interesting unit, not least because of the implications and the reasoning behind augmenting the metadata with extra semantics. I&#8217;ve written about semantic information before (see <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/semantic-pages\/\">Semantic Pages<\/a>, a post in the <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/07\/30-days-of-ui5\/\">30 Days of UI5<\/a> series). This time it&#8217;s about adding extra information to the OData metadata to enable a more rapid construction &#8211; in some cases automatic &#8211; of UI5 based application components. A control, or set of controls, that can understand the data that is bound to it, is capable of more than acting passively.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot driving the concept of annotations and their use in smart controls and templates, not least SAP&#8217;s need to produce yet more SAP Fiori apps, more quickly and more reliably. Finding a way for apps, or parts of apps, to write themselves, is going to help that process.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that made me smile was the lovely conflict between Unit 2&#8217;s statement &#8220;<em>OData model is based on &#8230; JSON<\/em>&#8221; and Unit 3&#8217;s statement &#8220;<em>OData is based on XML<\/em>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we all know that it&#8217;s based on both. JSON and XML just happen to be used to provide the format for the payload &#8211; there are different formats that the OData standard describes. But OData is also a protocol. Don&#8217;t let this confusion confuse you &#8211; OData is about more than representing data, it&#8217;s about describing operations upon that data too. The XML representation originates\u00a0from the Atom Syndication Format (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rfc-base.org\/rfc-4287.html\">RFC4287<\/a>) &#8211; this informs the &#8220;format&#8221; part of OData. The operations originate from the Atom Publishing Protocol (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rfc-base.org\/rfc-5023.html\">RFC5023<\/a>) &#8211; this informs the &#8220;protocol&#8221; part of OData.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design Challenge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And what of the Design Challenge?

This week sees the end of the deadline extension for the Design Challenge that I [wrote about in Week 3](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-week-3-get-ready-to-create-your-first-app\/), but mainly is about introducing the course attendee to some basic hands on with the SAP Web IDE. Let\u2019s have a look at how this unit went.\n\n**Unit 1 \u201cIntroduction to SAP Web IDE\u201d.** I\u2019m guessing that the majority of this course\u2019s attendees may well have some familiarity with SAP\u2019s now-flagship interactive development environment (IDE). It had an interesting genesis, growing from an initial offering called App Designer, which, remained a young product but seemed like it might be aiming to become, for UI5, what the Microsoft tools were for Visual Basic. There was also App Builder, which one might say was a competing product, from the Sybase stable. And how can we forget the tools and accelerators for various\u00a0workstation versions of Eclipse.\n\nWhat came out of that cloud of dust is what is becoming a very fine product indeed \u2013 the SAP Web IDE. Technically based upon Eclipse, but Orion \u2013 meaning the offering can be cloud-based, which it is. That said, there are the occasional releases of personal versions to run on one\u2019s workstation, but of course these are still web-based \u2013 you\u2019re just running Orion locally.\n\nThis is not a new concept. While today no-one bats an eyelid when we talk of running web servers locally on our laptops, it was a big \u201caha\u201d moment for me and many others back in the 1990\u2019s when one of my all time heroes Jon Udell wrote about the concept in Byte magazine a long long time ago now. There\u2019s an online version of the article here: [Distributed HTTP](http:\/\/jonudell.net\/dhttp\/dhttp.html).\n\nAnyway, I won\u2019t go into all the features of the Web IDE here \u2013 find out for yourself in this unit. You\u2019re not attending the course? Get that sorted now!\n\n**Unit 2 \u201cSAP Web IDE App Development Basics\u201d.**\u00a0This unit covered the basics in terms of what features the Web IDE has to support the end-to-end process described in Unit 1 \u2013 Prototype \u2013 Develop \u2013 Test \u2013 Package & Deploy \u2013 Extend.\n\nOne of the challenges when developing UI5 and Fiori apps is the data. Where is it, what does the structure look like, and is it actually available at all yet? The mock data services within the Web IDE go a long way towards smoothing over the answers to these questions. Often you\u2019ll be developing an app before a backend OData service is even available. Perhaps that\u2019s your modus operandi anyway. And even if the OData service is built, there may be no actual data to test with. With the mock data services you can mock your backend very nicely. See the last unit of this week (towards the end of this post) for more content on mock data services.\n\nAnd with the Web IDE you have many of the facilities you\u2019d expect in other IDEs \u2013 code completion, the ability to lint and beautify,\u00a0integration with source code control (in the form of git, of course) and more.\n\nAs a (very) long time [vim](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vim_(text_editor)) user, I have to say that an IDE (rather than \u201cjust\u201d an editor), and one in the cloud, is a concept that doesn\u2019t come naturally to me. But what the Web IDE offers is too good to ignore, so it\u2019s become my companion working environment of choice. And I recommend it to clients and colleagues alike if they\u2019re wanting to start on their Fiori journey.\n\n**Unit 3 \u201cCreating Your First SAP Fiori App with SAP Web IDE Templates\u201d.\u00a0**One of the reasons why the Web IDE is my companion working environment is covered in this unit: App starter templates and reference apps. I built my own starter templates a good while ago for my own development workflow, but I don\u2019t maintain them, and there\u2019s only a couple\u00a0of them. With the templates available in the Web IDE, you can hit the ground running and have a working basic\u00a0app in a matter of minutes.\n\nAnd the templates are maintained too; this means that as the best practices improve, and the maturing\u00a0of UI5 continues, there are differences in approach that you want to make sure you capture. With the plugin based architecture of the Web IDE, you can even build your own templates. As an experiment, a good while ago now when this was quite new, I created a custom template that allowed you to get started quickly with test data from a Google spreadsheet:\u00a0[SAP Fiori Rapid Prototyping: SAP Web IDE and Google Docs](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jAp_nGqOT_c).\n\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/jAp_nGqOT_c\" width=\"420\"><\/iframe>\n\nAn equally good reason to look at what the Web IDE has to offer are the reference apps. These are full blown apps that are a great source of wonderment \u2013 audited source code that covers myriad functions and mechanisms in real Fiori apps. You either enjoy reading source code or you don\u2019t. If you do, you\u2019re in for a treat. If you don\u2019t, grasp the nettle and at least have a go. I\u2019ve always maintained that reading other people\u2019s source code is educational (sometimes to see how *not* to do something!). And here\u2019s no exception. The world of SAP development is changing \u2013 use these resources to give yourself a leg up. And SAP \u2013 more of this please!\n\n**Unit 4 \u201cEnhancing Your SAP Fiori App with SAP Web IDE\u201d.**\u00a0This was a fairly straightforward unit, where the instructor takes us through a couple of examples of enhancing existing SAP Fiori apps. Rather than use the visual editor, we are shown the regular editor where the view is modified by adding XML elements as shown in the screenshot from the video below. This is fine, and my preferred modus operandi.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.30.11](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.30.11.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.30.11.png)\n\nBut I do wonder if attendees are thinking: \u201chow would I *know* that I could or should place an <attributes> element there, and within that element, an <ObjectAttribute>. And what about the capitalisation? Well, for those who can\u2019t wait for the coming weeks, where I suspect, or hope, that this is covered in a little bit more detail, here are a couple of pointers:\n\n1. If an XML element starts with a capital letter, it\u00a0represents a control. For example, we see on line 6 in the screenshot, an <ObjectHeader>.\n\n2. If you look at the reference for this Object Header control in the excellent Explored app within the UI5 SDK \u2013 [sap.m.ObjectHeader](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.ObjectHeader\/samples) \u2013 you\u2019ll see in the Aggregations tab a list of aggregations. And there you\u2019ll find the \u201cattributes\u201d aggregation, which contains entities of type \u201cObjectAttribute\u201d. And these are the children that can be placed inside the \u201cattributes\u201d aggregation.\n\n3. So yes, you guessed it \u2013 whereas controls are represented as XML elements with capitalised names, aggregations are represented by XML elements starting with lowercase letters. So <attributes> here in line 9 is the start of the list of Object Attributes within the \u201cattributes\u201d aggregation belonging to the Object Header control.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.39.34](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.39.34.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.39.34.png)\n\nI\u2019m sure that this sort of information will be covered in much more detail in the upcoming openSAP course on SAPUI5 \u2013 watch this space! :-)\n\n**Unit 4 \u201cTesting an App with Mock Data\u201d.**\u00a0Ahh, a pain point in every developer\u2019s workflow \u2013 \u201cWhere do I get the data to test?\u201d \u201cWhen will the backend service be ready?\u201d \u201cCan I start development sooner?\u201d. \u00a0Well with the mock data service things are a lot smoother than you might imagine.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely worth studying the Web IDE features explained in this unit. While the OData Model Editor is still something I\u2019d like to see improved (adding some visual aspects to the *editing* process, rather than still having to edit at the rather verbose EDMX level), it\u2019s still a great first step, especially with the visual display of the entities and their relationships:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.50.59](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.50.59-1024x854.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.50.59.png)\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that this wasn\u2019t shown in this unit.\n\nWhat was shown is the the Mock Data Editor is definitely easy to use and a great boost to your testing workflow. If you\u2019re going to invest some time on this week\u2019s content, this unit is where you should focus your efforts.\n\nAnd with that, week 5 is just about to start. See you next time!\n\n\u2014\n\n(For links to commentary for further weeks, see the first post in this series:\u00a0[\u201cfiux2\u2033 \u2013 The openSAP Fiori Course \u2013 2016 Edition](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-the-opensap-fiori-course-2016-edition\/).)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>Well we&#8217;re pretty much at the half-way point in this course, and it&#8217;s going well.

This is fine, and my preferred modus operandi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.30.11.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-2489 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.30.11.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.30.11\" width=\"374\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>But I do wonder if attendees are thinking: &#8220;how would I *know* that I could or should place an &lt;attributes&gt; element there, and within that element, an &lt;ObjectAttribute&gt;. And what about the capitalisation? Well, for those who can&#8217;t wait for the coming weeks, where I suspect, or hope, that this is covered in a little bit more detail, here are a couple of pointers:<\/p>\n<p>1. If an XML element starts with a capital letter, it\u00a0represents a control. For example, we see on line 6 in the screenshot, an &lt;ObjectHeader&gt;.<\/p>\n<p>2. If you look at the reference for this Object Header control in the excellent Explored app within the UI5 SDK &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/explored.html#\/entity\/sap.m.ObjectHeader\/samples\">sap.m.ObjectHeader<\/a> &#8211; you&#8217;ll see in the Aggregations tab a list of aggregations. And there you&#8217;ll find the &#8220;attributes&#8221; aggregation, which contains entities of type &#8220;ObjectAttribute&#8221;. And these are the children that can be placed inside the &#8220;attributes&#8221; aggregation.<\/p>\n<p>3. So yes, you guessed it &#8211; whereas controls are represented as XML elements with capitalised names, aggregations are represented by XML elements starting with lowercase letters. So &lt;attributes&gt; here in line 9 is the start of the list of Object Attributes within the &#8220;attributes&#8221; aggregation belonging to the Object Header control.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.39.34.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2490\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.39.34.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.39.34\" width=\"734\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure that this sort of information will be covered in much more detail in the upcoming openSAP course on SAPUI5 &#8211; watch this space! :-)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 4 &#8220;Testing an App with Mock Data&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Ahh, a pain point in every developer&#8217;s workflow &#8211; &#8220;Where do I get the data to test?&#8221; &#8220;When will the backend service be ready?&#8221; &#8220;Can I start development sooner?&#8221;. \u00a0Well with the mock data service things are a lot smoother than you might imagine.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely worth studying the Web IDE features explained in this unit. While the OData Model Editor is still something I&#8217;d like to see improved (adding some visual aspects to the *editing* process, rather than still having to edit at the rather verbose EDMX level), it&#8217;s still a great first step, especially with the visual display of the entities and their relationships:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.50.59.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2493\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-24-at-07.50.59-1024x854.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-24 at 07.50.59\" width=\"625\" height=\"521\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a shame that this wasn&#8217;t shown in this unit.<\/p>\n<p>What was shown is the the Mock Data Editor is definitely easy to use and a great boost to your testing workflow.

This week sees the introduction of the Develop Challenge, as well as the main content of this week \u2013\u00a0looking at more advanced features of the SAP Web IDE. Let\u2019s review\u00a0the units.\n\n**Unit 1 \u201cEnhancing Your SAP Fiori App with the Layout Editor\u201d.** This was a good introduction to the Layout Editor \u2013 an alternative way to edit Fiori app views. The Layout Editor is an accomplished piece of software, especially when you consider it\u2019s running in the browser. I wouldn\u2019t say it is my first choice for editing view definitions, but for the occasional user, it might be just the right thing. (There\u2019s an argument that says occasional users shouldn\u2019t be messing around with the innards of Fiori apps, but I\u2019ll leave that for another day).\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to remember that one of the reasons why such a thing as the Layout Editor is possible (and indeed the view part of the extension concept). Views in UI5 can be defined imperatively, in JavaScript, or they can be defined declaratively in\u00a0JSON, HTML or XML. All three of these declarative formats are much easier to parse and manipulate programmatically \u2013 which is what the Layout Editor is doing.\n\nThe format of choice for Fiori apps is XML \u2013 I wrote an introduction to XML views, contrasting them to their (then-more-popular) JavaScript equivalents, in a post as part of a series ([Mobile Dev Course W3U3 Rewrite](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/developer-center\/front-end\/blog\/2013\/10\/16\/mobile-dev-course-w3u3-rewrite--intro)) on the SAP Community Network back in 2013:\u00a0[Mobile Dev Course W3U3 Rewrite \u2013 XML Views \u2013 An Intro](http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-49095). If you\u2019re still trying to decide what format to use, XML should be where you start \u2013 simple as that.\n\nAnyway, take a look at this unit to find out more about the Layout Editor. Moreover, if you haven\u2019t used it yourself, there\u2019s a related exercise which goes into great detail \u2013 including data binding. The 34-page exercise document is called \u201cEnhance Your SAP Fiori App with the Layout Editor\u201d and it sits between this unit and the next.\n\n**Unit 2\u00a0\u201cDevelop Challenge: Build Your Own App with Peer Review\u201d.**\u00a0Can you say \u201cmeta-course\u201d? This unit merely covered the details of the Design Challenge. That said, \u201cmerely\u201d doesn\u2019t really do justice to this unit, or the information imparted.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot packed into this course, including two major hands-on activities \u2013 the Design Challenge and the Develop Challenge, with their respective peer review activities to boot. I\u2019m struggling a little to keep\u00a0up with what\u2019s required, especially as I\u2019m dipping in and out of the course material when I have time.\n\nSo while this unit helps, I\u2019m still a bit\u00a0confused \u2013 particularly about when the peer review for the Design Challenge is to start. That confusion was increased by the deadline extension given for this challenge ([that I mentioned last week](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2%E2%80%B3-week-4-create-your-first-sap-fiori-app\/)). But perhaps I\u2019m just getting old.\u00a0I checked my Study submitted via Build \/ Splash, but have had no peer feedback yet. Nor have I had any prompting to start the peer review (we all get 5 submissions to review).\n\nUpdate \u2013 I did some digging around, and you can now get to the peer review section within the Design Challenge section, as shown here:\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-03-31 at 08.43.06](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-31-at-08.43.06.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-31-at-08.43.06.png)\n\nSo don\u2019t wait for any prompts or emails\u00a0\u2013 just go there and start!\n\n**Unit 3 \u201cOther Considerations in Building an SAP Fiori App\u201d.**\u00a0Well this was certainly a challenging unit! Challenging for the audience (it was a sudden slip off the relaxing poolside into the deep water), for the presenter (squeezing that much content into a 15 minute video was clearly a struggle) and challenging for the course as a whole, because while extremely important, it didn\u2019t really fit into the flow of where this course has come from.\n\nAs a small example, one of the slides showed a snippet of a key artifact in any Fiori app \u2013 the Component.js file (unfortunately written on the slide as Component**s**.js). To understand the context, the audience would have to have some non-trivial knowledge of UI5 development. This is coming (in a course starting in April, hurray!) but we\u2019re not there yet.\n\nIt was like a whirlwind tour of lots of small performance and security related topics, which if done properly, could be expanded into a 3 or 4 day course :-) So in that sense, it was useful to impart. But I wonder how much of that information was really understood?\n\nThis unit talked about OData Choreography \u2013 a phrase I like \u2013 but it also had a couple of questionable pieces of advice, at least in my view. If you want only three properties of an entity rather than the three hundred it normally sports, you were advised to create another OData service. That\u2019s not what I\u2019d do \u2013 rather, I\u2019d use the power of the OData protocol and use the query string option \u201c[$select](http:\/\/www.odata.org\/documentation\/odata-version-2-0\/uri-conventions\/)\u201d to return just the properties I needed.\n\nI also do baulk somewhat at the recommendation to use [$batch](http:\/\/www.odata.org\/documentation\/odata-version-2-0\/batch-processing\/). In a TLS (ie HTTPS) context, URI security is fine, and while increasing performance (by batching up multiple requests), batching makes the application mechanics more opaque and difficult to support and debug. The approach also flies in the face of the architectural style that has informed the OData protocol as a whole \u2013 REpresentational State Transfer (REST). Don\u2019t mask resource identifiers (URIs) and hide them where they don\u2019t belong!\n\nFinally, it would have been nice to hear a more compelling explanation of the reasonings behind the \u201cone app \/ one service\u201d rule. But perhaps that\u2019s coming later.\n\nAll in all this unit was a useful, if slightly inconguent, poke in the ribs for the attendees to let them know it\u2019s not just point-and-click in the Web IDE Layout Editor. I guess my comment about occasional users earlier in this post is relevant here too :-)\n\n**Unit 4 \u201cCreating an SAP Fiori App with a Smart Template\u201d.**\u00a0The combination of OData, annotations, and Smart Templates is a powerful one. We had a brief introduction to Smart Templates in [week 3](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-week-3-get-ready-to-create-your-first-app\/)\u00a0so I need not dwell on them too much again here.\n\nSuffice it to say that this unit\u00a0showed a pretty impressive demo \u2013 a happy path demo, but a good one nevertheless. One of the things that stood out from the slide notes, and brought up by the presenter, was that with Smart Templates, there are \u201cNO modifications\u201d. I\u2019ve yet to find out what that really implies; read-only code sometimes goes hand-in hand with auto-generation, but I\u2019m pretty certain that what we\u2019re going to end up with is something workable. The UI5 toolkit itself does a lot of the heavy lifting here, so it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a ton of code that\u2019s being emitted.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an extremely interesting area, and one to watch and learn more about.\n\n**Unit 5\u00a0\u201cIntroduction to SAP Fiori Overview Page\u201d.**\u00a0Pretty much a continuation of the previous unit, here we move on to another concrete artifact from the \u201csmart\u201d stable \u2013 the Overview Page, or OVP.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-03-30 at 18.02.54](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-30-at-18.02.54.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-30-at-18.02.54.png)\n\nYou can\u2019t help but be impressed by\u00a0and\u00a0attracted to this lovely\u00a0combination of\u00a0practical and visually appealing functionality. It\u2019s a cross between the Fiori Launchpad and functions and features of Fiori apps, all on a single page.\n\nBut perhaps what\u2019s most impressive is the way that the OVP plugin works and embeds itself seamlessly into the Web IDE. The generation of the core OVP example was impressive, but what really took my fancy was the addition, in the demo, of actual cards, via further wizards. When you consider the different teams that have been involved, it\u2019s a great example of the tip of a complex iceberg, both technically and organisationally at SAP. Nice work, teams!\n\nBy the way \u2013 if this sort of UI presentation appeals to you, you may be interested in a free 1-hour webinar I\u2019m involved in on 26 Apr. For more information, see the event\u2019s homepage:\n\n[The SAP Fiori Launchpad as a Human-Centric Dashboard](http:\/\/www.bluefinsolutions.com\/events\/the-sap-fiori-launchpad-as-a-human-centric-dashboa)\n\nand maybe I\u2019ll see you there!\n\n**Unit 6 \u201cDeploying Your App\u201d.**\u00a0This was the last main unit of this week\u2019s course content, and covered, at a high level, what you do next after building your Fiori app. Basically there are a couple of main options \u2013 a deployment to a Fiori Launchpad site on the HCP cloud portal, or a deployment to an ABAP stack backend SAP system. There was another option shown in the slide and in the demo, to \u201cclone *to* a git repository\u201d. I can only think there was a little bit of confusion here \u2013 git clone goes the other way \u2013 creating (pulling) a copy of an existing repository, not instantiating (pushing) a new repository.\n\nBut we\u2019ll gloss over that for now, especially as the key git parts of the workflow \u2013 when deploying to HCP \u2013 were actually shown. There are some gotchas with the git workflow when it comes to using different branches (which you should be doing during development). You may be interesting in this screencast I recorded showing you the challenge, and the solution: \u201c[SAP HCP, git, and Feature Branches](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OtCt8lQAttA)\u201c.\n\nIt was good to see the relationship between the app itself, the portal FLP site, HCP along with the roles, even though it was a very quick high level overview. Almost directly after\u00a0the video was recorded (mid Dec 2015) some improvements have been made\u00a0to this area, notably, with SAP Web IDE release 1.19, the ability to specify *which* FLP site you want to deploy the app to. You can have multiple FLP sites in your HCP portal account, and the ability to specify the right\u00a0target site is key.\u00a0See \u201c[Registering Applications to SAP Fiori Launchpad](https:\/\/help.hana.ondemand.com\/webide\/frameset.htm?b075d767e91f422b8b4be4e8c6fd5ab7.html)\u201d documentation for more details.\n\nOne thing that struck me as a little odd was the tile definition demo.\u00a0After the Tile Configuration part of the wizard was complete, we looked at the tile in the FLP, but it had different text (title and subtitle) to what had been defined. I can only think that this might have been the product of a video splice \u2026 and serves as a reminder of how hard it is to create even one tutorial video, let alone multiple series! (I speak from first hand here). So my hat goes off to the teams that turn out such great content for all these openSAP courses.\n\nFor some of the audience, it might have been worth just spending a bit of time explaining the BSP Application connection, when the deployment to an ABAP repository was shown. Of course, there isn\u2019t a connection \u2013 you\u2019re not travelling back in time to the Business Server Pages technology arena; rather, it\u2019s just that the storage container for a BSP Application was deemed \u201cgood enough\u201d to contain all the artifacts of a Fiori app \u2013 it being a web app after all.\n\nOn the subject of deployment, this time to the FLP, it would have also been nice to mention the difference between the \u201cwebapp\u201d folder and the \u201cdist\u201d folder created in such circumstances. But perhaps that will come up in another course.\n\nDespite these gaps, it was\u00a0a good overview unit that completed the picture.\n\nPost Script: one of the self-test questions for this unit rather unfortunately suffered from perhaps being set by someone other than the person who wrote or presented the unit video content; there isn\u2019t a single \u201ccorrect process for deploying an SAP Fiori app to the cloud Launchpad\u201d, and the officially correct answer doesn\u2019t reflect the procedure that was shown in the video. Ah well, it\u2019s only a self-test :-)\n\nThat\u2019s about it for this week\u00a0\u2013\u00a0see you next time!\n\n\u2014\n\n(For links to commentary for further weeks, see the first post in this series:\u00a0[\u201cfiux2\u2033 \u2013 The openSAP Fiori Course \u2013 2016 Edition](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-the-opensap-fiori-course-2016-edition\/).)\n\n\n","html":"<p>So week 5 came and went rather quickly &#8211; perhaps it was the Bank Holiday weekend! This week sees the introduction of the Develop Challenge, as well as the main content of this week &#8211;\u00a0looking at more advanced features of the SAP Web IDE. Let&#8217;s review\u00a0the units.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 1 &#8220;Enhancing Your SAP Fiori App with the Layout Editor&#8221;.<\/strong> This was a good introduction to the Layout Editor &#8211; an alternative way to edit Fiori app views. The Layout Editor is an accomplished piece of software, especially when you consider it&#8217;s running in the browser. I wouldn&#8217;t say it is my first choice for editing view definitions, but for the occasional user, it might be just the right thing. (There&#8217;s an argument that says occasional users shouldn&#8217;t be messing around with the innards of Fiori apps, but I&#8217;ll leave that for another day).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to remember that one of the reasons why such a thing as the Layout Editor is possible (and indeed the view part of the extension concept). Views in UI5 can be defined imperatively, in JavaScript, or they can be defined declaratively in\u00a0JSON, HTML or XML. All three of these declarative formats are much easier to parse and manipulate programmatically &#8211; which is what the Layout Editor is doing.<\/p>\n<p>The format of choice for Fiori apps is XML &#8211; I wrote an introduction to XML views, contrasting them to their (then-more-popular) JavaScript equivalents, in a post as part of a series (<a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/community\/developer-center\/front-end\/blog\/2013\/10\/16\/mobile-dev-course-w3u3-rewrite--intro\">Mobile Dev Course W3U3 Rewrite<\/a>) on the SAP Community Network back in 2013:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/scn.sap.com\/docs\/DOC-49095\">Mobile Dev Course W3U3 Rewrite &#8211; XML Views &#8211; An Intro<\/a>. If you&#8217;re still trying to decide what format to use, XML should be where you start &#8211; simple as that.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, take a look at this unit to find out more about the Layout Editor. Moreover, if you haven&#8217;t used it yourself, there&#8217;s a related exercise which goes into great detail &#8211; including data binding. The 34-page exercise document is called &#8220;Enhance Your SAP Fiori App with the Layout Editor&#8221; and it sits between this unit and the next.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 2\u00a0&#8220;Develop Challenge: Build Your Own App with Peer Review&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Can you say &#8220;meta-course&#8221;? This unit merely covered the details of the Design Challenge. That said, &#8220;merely&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really do justice to this unit, or the information imparted.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot packed into this course, including two major hands-on activities &#8211; the Design Challenge and the Develop Challenge, with their respective peer review activities to boot. I&#8217;m struggling a little to keep\u00a0up with what&#8217;s required, especially as I&#8217;m dipping in and out of the course material when I have time.<\/p>\n<p>So while this unit helps, I&#8217;m still a bit\u00a0confused &#8211; particularly about when the peer review for the Design Challenge is to start. That confusion was increased by the deadline extension given for this challenge (<a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2%E2%80%B3-week-4-create-your-first-sap-fiori-app\/\">that I mentioned last week<\/a>). But perhaps I&#8217;m just getting old.\u00a0I checked my Study submitted via Build \/ Splash, but have had no peer feedback yet. Nor have I had any prompting to start the peer review (we all get 5 submissions to review).<\/p>\n<p>Update &#8211; I did some digging around, and you can now get to the peer review section within the Design Challenge section, as shown here:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-31-at-08.43.06.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2535\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-31-at-08.43.06.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-31 at 08.43.06\" width=\"290\" height=\"129\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t wait for any prompts or emails\u00a0&#8211; just go there and start!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 3 &#8220;Other Considerations in Building an SAP Fiori App&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Well this was certainly a challenging unit! Challenging for the audience (it was a sudden slip off the relaxing poolside into the deep water), for the presenter (squeezing that much content into a 15 minute video was clearly a struggle) and challenging for the course as a whole, because while extremely important, it didn&#8217;t really fit into the flow of where this course has come from.<\/p>\n<p>As a small example, one of the slides showed a snippet of a key artifact in any Fiori app &#8211; the Component.js file (unfortunately written on the slide as Component<strong>s<\/strong>.js). To understand the context, the audience would have to have some non-trivial knowledge of UI5 development. This is coming (in a course starting in April, hurray!) but we&#8217;re not there yet.<\/p>\n<p>It was like a whirlwind tour of lots of small performance and security related topics, which if done properly, could be expanded into a 3 or 4 day course :-) So in that sense, it was useful to impart. But I wonder how much of that information was really understood?<\/p>\n<p>This unit talked about OData Choreography &#8211; a phrase I like &#8211; but it also had a couple of questionable pieces of advice, at least in my view. If you want only three properties of an entity rather than the three hundred it normally sports, you were advised to create another OData service. That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;d do &#8211; rather, I&#8217;d use the power of the OData protocol and use the query string option &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.odata.org\/documentation\/odata-version-2-0\/uri-conventions\/\">$select<\/a>&#8221; to return just the properties I needed.<\/p>\n<p>I also do baulk somewhat at the recommendation to use <a href=\"http:\/\/www.odata.org\/documentation\/odata-version-2-0\/batch-processing\/\">$batch<\/a>. In a TLS (ie HTTPS) context, URI security is fine, and while increasing performance (by batching up multiple requests), batching makes the application mechanics more opaque and difficult to support and debug. The approach also flies in the face of the architectural style that has informed the OData protocol as a whole &#8211; REpresentational State Transfer (REST). Don&#8217;t mask resource identifiers (URIs) and hide them where they don&#8217;t belong!<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it would have been nice to hear a more compelling explanation of the reasonings behind the &#8220;one app \/ one service&#8221; rule. But perhaps that&#8217;s coming later.<\/p>\n<p>All in all this unit was a useful, if slightly inconguent, poke in the ribs for the attendees to let them know it&#8217;s not just point-and-click in the Web IDE Layout Editor. I guess my comment about occasional users earlier in this post is relevant here too :-)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 4 &#8220;Creating an SAP Fiori App with a Smart Template&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0The combination of OData, annotations, and Smart Templates is a powerful one. We had a brief introduction to Smart Templates in <a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2016\/03\/fiux2-week-3-get-ready-to-create-your-first-app\/\">week 3<\/a>\u00a0so I need not dwell on them too much again here.<\/p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that this unit\u00a0showed a pretty impressive demo &#8211; a happy path demo, but a good one nevertheless. One of the things that stood out from the slide notes, and brought up by the presenter, was that with Smart Templates, there are &#8220;NO modifications&#8221;. I&#8217;ve yet to find out what that really implies; read-only code sometimes goes hand-in hand with auto-generation, but I&#8217;m pretty certain that what we&#8217;re going to end up with is something workable. The UI5 toolkit itself does a lot of the heavy lifting here, so it&#8217;s not as if there&#8217;s a ton of code that&#8217;s being emitted.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely an extremely interesting area, and one to watch and learn more about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 5\u00a0&#8220;Introduction to SAP Fiori Overview Page&#8221;.<\/strong>\u00a0Pretty much a continuation of the previous unit, here we move on to another concrete artifact from the &#8220;smart&#8221; stable &#8211; the Overview Page, or OVP.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-30-at-18.02.54.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-2519\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-30-at-18.02.54.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-03-30 at 18.02.54\" width=\"568\" height=\"277\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t help but be impressed by\u00a0and\u00a0attracted to this lovely\u00a0combination of\u00a0practical and visually appealing functionality. It&#8217;s a cross between the Fiori Launchpad and functions and features of Fiori apps, all on a single page.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps what&#8217;s most impressive is the way that the OVP plugin works and embeds itself seamlessly into the Web IDE. The generation of the core OVP example was impressive, but what really took my fancy was the addition, in the demo, of actual cards, via further wizards. When you consider the different teams that have been involved, it&#8217;s a great example of the tip of a complex iceberg, both technically and organisationally at SAP.

Phew! Let\u2019s take a look at the units this week.\n\n**Unit 1 \u201cIntroduction to SAP Fiori Extensibility with SAPUI5\u2033.** This was quite a good overview of the different extension capabilities with SAP Fiori. It\u2019s an introduction, so I didn\u2019t\u00a0expect to get a deep dive, but in fact the presentation of the extension concept, within the time and slide contents constraints, was a good one. It explained\u00a0the way that an extension project starts out lean, a \u201cdelta\u201d with the parent (or \u201coriginal\u201d) application, and then builds, as extensions are added. The slideware was good too \u2013 a clear and meaningful build up of the Component.js file.\n\nWhile the [extension concept of the SAPUI5 toolkit](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html) supports the core extension capabilities at the developer level, it was also interesting to see the [Runtime Adaptation](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/test-resources\/sap\/ui\/rta\/RuntimeAdaptationDemoApp.html?sap-rta-mock-lrep=true)\u00a0classed, along with general user-level customising possibilities, within the general extension umbrella. And rightly so. The Runtime Adaptation is quite an achievement; while still a relatively young concept and section of the SAPUI5 toolkit, it\u2019s definitely worth having a look. You could almost see it as \u201cPersonas for Fiori\u201d. Now how does *that* mess with your current pigeon-holing of tactical and strategic UX technologies? :-)\n\nThere were a couple of things that I wanted to draw your attention to with the extension concept, lest misunderstanding were to take hold:\n\n- You can extend\u00a0views with replacements (if there were no appropriate extension points for you to use), extensions (using the available extension points) and modifications. In this latter category, the slides say you can \u201cmodify certain properties like visibility\u201d. Actually, right now, [you can modify *only* the visible property](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/aa93e1c6953a41b48cd912a7331eadee.html), no others.\n- You can also extend controllers, where the slide says that you can \u201coverride standard controller functions such as lifecycle methods\u201d. There\u2019s an important distinction between the word \u201coverride\u201d (replace) and \u201cmerge\u201d \u2013 a word that the instructor actually used but wasn\u2019t on the slide. With the lifecycle methods, your custom \u201creplacement\u201d method doesn\u2019t actually override the equivalent lifecycle method, it is merged, and either runs before or runs after, depending on the method. This is actually what you want, but it\u2019s not \u201coverride\u201d.\n\nCaveat developer!\n\n**Unit 2\u00a0\u201cExtensibility with SAP Web IDE \u2013 SAP Fiori Cloud Example\u201d.** This unit is definitely worthwhile and a very quick walkthrough of what you can do yourself too. Last year at SAP TechEd EMEA, I was lucky enough to co-present a number of SAP Fiori related workshops (see \u201c[Speaking at SAP TechEd EMEA 2015](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/11\/speaking-at-sap-teched-emea-2015\/)\u201c). One of them was to have the participants walk through extending an app in the Fiori Cloud Edition, just like the instructor did in this unit. You can do it yourself too now \u2013 just visit the [SAP Fiori Demo Cloud Edition](https:\/\/www.sapfioritrial.com\/) home and follow your nose. There\u2019s also an exercise following this unit which will take you through something similar.\n\nWith extensions, we have many questions to answer. Why, how, what and where, for starters. The \u201cwhy\u201d is simple \u2013 because you want to have the app meet your specific business needs and nuances. The \u201chow\u201d is what this unit\u00a0covers at a high level:\u00a0the extension concept in general, along with the great support in the SAP Web IDE.\n\nBut it\u2019s the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d that will most likely cause the new SAP Fiori developer to scratch their head. What can I extend, and where do I find it?\u00a0Well this is partially answered in the details section of each SAP Fiori app in the [Fiori Apps Library](https:\/\/fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com\/sap\/fix\/externalViewer\/). But knowing how an app is generally structured, and knowing specifically how your particular app is structured, is a level of detail and understanding much deeper than that.\n\nAnd what, I hear you say, is the meaning of the S2, S3 and S4 view names? These are artifacts of the original SAP Fiori development approach within SAP, with S2 being the master view of a Master-Detail application, S3 being the detail, and so on. Getting inside the mind and the development context of the developer(s) that wrote the code you\u2019re trying to modify\u00a0(whether that\u2019s SAP Fiori or something completely different) is something you should try to do as it will make a big difference.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-04-04 at 07.57.57](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-07.57.57.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-07.57.57.png)Oh yes, one more thing \u2013 the instructor added an\u00a0event for the camera button he added to the S4 view. The event he chose from the list was \u201ctap\u201d, which was right next to \u201cpress\u201d in the list. Unfortunately [the Button control\u2019s \u201ctap\u201d event has been deprecated](https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/api\/symbols\/sap.m.Button.html#event:tap)\u00a0since 1.20 (in favour of the \u201cpress\u201d event), but as (a) the SAP Web IDE didn\u2019t highlight this (yet!) and (b) the clock on the instructor\u2019s screen showed just after 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, we can overlook this ;-)\n\n**Unit 3\u00a0\u201cIntroduction to Enabling SAP Fiori for Mobile\u201d.**\u00a0There\u2019s a ton of stuff that SAP (and Sybase) have developed in the area of mobile app creation, deployment and management. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one somewhat dazzled by the oncoming headlights of so much traffic in this area. So if for no other reason than to summarise where SAP stands today with respect to their direction and strategy in this area, this unit serves us well.\n\nIn a conversation last month, I was rather surprised to hear that there were some people who had not heard of the term \u201chybrid\u201d in the context of mobile apps.\u00a0This unit clears that up for folks, and explains what hybrid means. This word for me will forever have one of its original meanings from its Greek roots (\u1f55\u03b2\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2) \u2013 where it was used to describe the mythical [Chimaera](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chimera_(mythology)), made up of three different species of animal \u2013 and was an insult (think \u201chubris\u201d) to each one. I wonder if SAP considered this in the Hybris context?\n\nAnyway, the unit\u00a0actually\u00a0covers a lot of ground, at a high level, contextualising SAP Mobile Services (SAPms), Apache Cordova (nee PhoneGap), Kapsel, the SAP Fiori Client and much more besides. This is the sort of unit where you\u2019ll want to review the slides again later to make sure you\u2019ve built the right set of pigeonholes in your brain to store the flood of information that you know is going to come your way.\n\nOne\u00a0concept that was mentioned but never really expanded upon was the offline OData feature. That alone perhaps could have taken up a whole unit, a whole week, or (in depth) a whole course, but it would have been good for the participants to learn, even at a high level, what was possible.\n\n**Unit 4\u00a0\u201cExtending an SAP Fiori App for Mobile \u2013 Use Case\u201d.** Enough theory, how about some practical demonstration? And this unit delivers that. It continues the app from Unit 2 earlier in the week, and adds code to the event handler created then. It\u2019s sometimes difficult to keep up with dry material, so to see something in action is a nice diversion. It also shows that not everything is always perfect \u2013 even the happy path that the demonstration was following was marred slightly by some network issues (it looked like the mobile device momentarily dropped off the wifi network).\n\nIt would have been nice to dig a little deeper into the background behind the Hybrid Application Toolkit (HAT) settings, especially the connection between the workstation-local resources and the configuration in these settings (see screenshot).\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 07.09.29](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-07.09.29.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-07.09.29.png)\n\nI\u2019m thinking, however, that this is covered in the companion course \u201cDeveloping Mobile Apps with SAP HANA Cloud Platform\u201d.\n\n**Unit 5\u00a0\u201cCloud Extensions with SAP SuccessFactors\u201d.** If there ever was a unit that was full to bursting with a demo that makes you want to know more about absolutely everything, this unit comes close. Even at the longer length of 25 mins, this unit\u2019s video only managed to scratch the surface of extending SAP SuccessFactors with an embedded UI5 app.\n\nLooking past the clear signs of multiple SAP teams working on different parts of SAP\u2019s cloud strategy as a whole, I can\u2019t help but marvel at where they\u2019ve got to. Yes, a pedant like me can spot some inconsistencies and things that don\u2019t look right to the eye. There are also many questions relating to how things really connect and are authenticated, but on the whole, it was a good illustration of some of the core building blocks of the PaaS that HCP is.\n\nI\u2019m really glad that the example the instructor chose was consuming an OData service, via the Destinations facility of HCP. The backend exposing this OData service was marked as \u201codata_gen\u201d \u2013 just like you\u2019d mark any non-SAP (AS ABAP stack) OData service like Northwind.\n\n[![Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 17.36.12](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-17.36.12.png)](http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-05-at-17.36.12.png)\n\nI did wonder somewhat about the use of the\u00a0URL in the Widget specification \u2013 it was supposed to be the URL of the app on HCP, but instead was another one with \u201cdemo2\u2033 in the first part.

This time it\u2019s \u201c[Extending SAP Products with SAP HANA Cloud Platform](https:\/\/open.sap.com\/courses\/hanacloud3-1\/)\u201c.\n\nFinally, did you notice the use of [OpenSocial](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/OpenSocial)? Here\u2019s another example of SAP adopting open protocols and standards, like HTTP and OData. OpenSocial defines a component hosting environment and a set of APIs, and SAP use it to enable the mashup of different components (such as extensions) to run within the same document object model (web page). This continues to give me confidence and encourages me to invest time and effort learning about the technologies and uses thereof in this space, as I know I\u2019m less likely to be going down a path that leads nowhere.\n\nWell, that\u2019s the last main unit of this week. There was, as usual, the video blog update for this week, which I enjoyed.

Phew! Let&#8217;s take a look at the units this week.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 1 &#8220;Introduction to SAP Fiori Extensibility with SAPUI5&#8243;.<\/strong> This was quite a good overview of the different extension capabilities with SAP Fiori. It&#8217;s an introduction, so I didn&#8217;t\u00a0expect to get a deep dive, but in fact the presentation of the extension concept, within the time and slide contents constraints, was a good one. It explained\u00a0the way that an extension project starts out lean, a &#8220;delta&#8221; with the parent (or &#8220;original&#8221;) application, and then builds, as extensions are added. The slideware was good too &#8211; a clear and meaningful build up of the Component.js file.<\/p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/a264a9abf98d4caabbf9b027bc1005d8.html\">extension concept of the SAPUI5 toolkit<\/a> supports the core extension capabilities at the developer level, it was also interesting to see the <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/test-resources\/sap\/ui\/rta\/RuntimeAdaptationDemoApp.html?sap-rta-mock-lrep=true\">Runtime Adaptation<\/a>\u00a0classed, along with general user-level customising possibilities, within the general extension umbrella. And rightly so. The Runtime Adaptation is quite an achievement; while still a relatively young concept and section of the SAPUI5 toolkit, it&#8217;s definitely worth having a look. You could almost see it as &#8220;Personas for Fiori&#8221;. Now how does *that* mess with your current pigeon-holing of tactical and strategic UX technologies? :-)<\/p>\n<p>There were a couple of things that I wanted to draw your attention to with the extension concept, lest misunderstanding were to take hold:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can extend\u00a0views with replacements (if there were no appropriate extension points for you to use), extensions (using the available extension points) and modifications. In this latter category, the slides say you can &#8220;modify certain properties like visibility&#8221;. Actually, right now, <a href=\"https:\/\/sapui5.hana.ondemand.com\/#docs\/guide\/aa93e1c6953a41b48cd912a7331eadee.html\">you can modify *only* the visible property<\/a>, no others.<\/li>\n<li>You can also extend controllers, where the slide says that you can &#8220;override standard controller functions such as lifecycle methods&#8221;. There&#8217;s an important distinction between the word &#8220;override&#8221; (replace) and &#8220;merge&#8221; &#8211; a word that the instructor actually used but wasn&#8217;t on the slide. With the lifecycle methods, your custom &#8220;replacement&#8221; method doesn&#8217;t actually override the equivalent lifecycle method, it is merged, and either runs before or runs after, depending on the method. This is actually what you want, but it&#8217;s not &#8220;override&#8221;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Caveat developer!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unit 2\u00a0&#8220;Extensibility with SAP Web IDE \u2013 SAP Fiori Cloud Example&#8221;.<\/strong> This unit is definitely worthwhile and a very quick walkthrough of what you can do yourself too. Last year at SAP TechEd EMEA, I was lucky enough to co-present a number of SAP Fiori related workshops (see &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/2015\/11\/speaking-at-sap-teched-emea-2015\/\">Speaking at SAP TechEd EMEA 2015<\/a>&#8220;). One of them was to have the participants walk through extending an app in the Fiori Cloud Edition, just like the instructor did in this unit. You can do it yourself too now &#8211; just visit the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sapfioritrial.com\/\">SAP Fiori Demo Cloud Edition<\/a> home and follow your nose. There&#8217;s also an exercise following this unit which will take you through something similar.<\/p>\n<p>With extensions, we have many questions to answer. Why, how, what and where, for starters. The &#8220;why&#8221; is simple &#8211; because you want to have the app meet your specific business needs and nuances. The &#8220;how&#8221; is what this unit\u00a0covers at a high level:\u00a0the extension concept in general, along with the great support in the SAP Web IDE.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the &#8220;what&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; that will most likely cause the new SAP Fiori developer to scratch their head. What can I extend, and where do I find it?\u00a0Well this is partially answered in the details section of each SAP Fiori app in the <a href=\"https:\/\/fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com\/sap\/fix\/externalViewer\/\">Fiori Apps Library<\/a>. But knowing how an app is generally structured, and knowing specifically how your particular app is structured, is a level of detail and understanding much deeper than that.<\/p>\n<p>And what, I hear you say, is the meaning of the S2, S3 and S4 view names? These are artifacts of the original SAP Fiori development approach within SAP, with S2 being the master view of a Master-Detail application, S3 being the detail, and so on. Getting inside the mind and the development context of the developer(s) that wrote the code you&#8217;re trying to modify\u00a0(whether that&#8217;s SAP Fiori or something completely different) is something you should try to do as it will make a big difference.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-07.57.57.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-2544\" src=\"http:\/\/pipetree.com\/qmacro\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-07.57.57.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2016-04-04 at 07.57.57\" width=\"265\" height=\"198\" \/><\/a>Oh yes, one more thing &#8211; the instructor added an\u00a0event for the camera button he added to the S4 view.
