Sam has just had some difficulties subscribing to this weblog’s RSS feed. I checked the message he got, and looked at the XML produced by Blosxom. I’ve just added a `<description/>` tag and a `<language/>` tag (!) in the `<channel/>` section. I think that might be what was missing…

P.S. Thanks Jon for the email alert :-)
