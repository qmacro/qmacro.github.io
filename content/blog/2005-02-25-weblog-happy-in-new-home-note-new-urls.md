If you subscribed to my weblog via RSS and read it solely in RSS readers, you might have wondered what
had happened recently when the RSS feeds disappeared. Well, it’s moved. I’m having [a fresh
start](/blog/posts/2005/02/18/a-fresh-start/), with different blog software, with slightly different
URLs. You can find this weblog now at <https://qmacro.org/blog/>.
