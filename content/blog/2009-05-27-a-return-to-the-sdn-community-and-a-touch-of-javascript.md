A few days ago, Mark Yolton pointed out to me that this Friday, 30th May will mark 6 years since my first SDN blog post “[The SAP/MySQL Partnership](/blog/posts/2003/05/30/the-sapmysql-partnership/)“, in SDN’s first month.

My oh my, how things have changed and progessed! We’ve seen the rise and rise of Open Source, the rise and fall of SOA, and the [incredible improvements](/tweets/qmacro/status/1794857024/) in connectedness and social collaboration in SAP events such as Sapphire & TechEd. Excellent.

Some things haven’t changed so much, though. I’m reading SDN in earnest again — especially the weblog posts. And guess what? The use of frames in SAP portal technology is still hampering basic usability. A particular case in point is bookmarking; I can’t usefully or easily bookmark a weblog post without some cut’n’paste gymnastics, because the page title is always the same: “SAP Network Blogs”. It should be the entry-specific weblog post title, so you don’t end up with 1001 bookmarks that you can’t tell apart.

Not to worry. A couple of Greasemonkey Javascript lines later, in the form of [sdnpagetitle.user.js](https://github.com/qmacro/sdnpagetitle/blob/master/sdnpagetitle.user.js), (in the [sdnpagetitle github repository](https://github.com/qmacro/sdnpagetitle)) and things are fixed!

Funny, my last post before this one was [OssNoteFix script updated for Greasemonkey 0.6.4 and Firefox 1.5](/blog/posts/2006/02/07/ossnotefix-script-updated-for-greasemonkey-0.6.4-and-firefox-1.5/) too!

Share and enjoy, and here’s to the next 6 years 🙂
