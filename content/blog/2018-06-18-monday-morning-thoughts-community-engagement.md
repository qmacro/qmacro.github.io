I was re-listening to a great episode of the [Coffee Corner Radio
podcast](https://anchor.fm/sap-community-podcast/) on my trip over to
the mothership yesterday (I'm over in Walldorf this week helping out at
a partner workshop and then of course attending and speaking at
[UI5con](https://openui5.org/ui5con/), hurray!) The episode
was Jakob Kjaer and Simon Kemp's
[interview](https://anchor.fm/sap-community-podcast/episodes/Episode-3-Interview-with-Craig-Cmehil-e1ievh)
with Craig Cmehil on the SAP Community.

Craig has his head screwed on right, and what was said in the interview
resonated very well with me, in particular the conversation about
engagement online. I co-created the SAP community back in the day, when
it was born as the SAP Developer Network (aka "SDN"), so there will
always be a part of me that wants to see the community survive and
thrive.

## Upward curve

The community has been through some good times, and some bad, but I feel
that we're on an upward curve, especially thanks to the goodwill of
core participants, and of course to great initiatives like Coffee Corner
Radio. Moreover, I think that Craig's leadership is just what the
community in general, but the online community in particular, needs.
I'm saying this as a long time observer of Craig as much as a colleague
and good friend.

Before SDN, I started an SAP practitioner mailing list "merlin" in the
mid 1990's. Merlin merged with Bryan Thorp's "sapr3-list" mailing
list some years later to become SAP-R3-L, and I know that some readers
will certainly remember that mailing list!

## Aspects that keep a community healthy

While managing the mailing lists, I was working away from home on
various projects, and I remember particularly my evenings in the Skean
Dhu hotel in Aberdeen where I spent a couple of hours every evening
after work, on my Sanyo laptop (with its built-in 2400baud modem!),
administering and nurturing the conversations. In the context of
today's challenges, those memories can be distilled into simple aspects
that make for a good and healthy community.

There will always be those who come in directly, looking for someone
else to do their work for them, even do their Googling for them, and
then leave with no warning or goodbye. This is not particular to the SAP
Community - you see it everywhere. But as Craig intimated - let them be.
In my view, they have no manners, but we won't be able to change their
ways, not all of them, anyway.

On the flip side, there always has been, especially if not more so
today, a backbone of sharing that has been the mainstay of the SAP
Community. I'd like to concentrate on that, and suggest that there are
a couple of things that only serve to amplify and encourage such great
interaction.

## Acknowledgement and engagement

The first is something I've mentioned already - manners. It doesn't
take much to say please and thank you, and simply acknowledge one's
fellow Community members. And for such a small amount of effort, the
return is immense. During the podcast episode, Craig, Simon and Jakob
talked about recognition, being something that people enjoy and perhaps
are driven by. This is true, and very good. But I think there's a more
basic form of that, which is acknowledgement. If someone is making the
effort to engage with you, reply to a question, make a comment, they can
be acknowledged by a simple gesture, whether that's a reciprocal
comment, a like, or an upvote. If folks' efforts are not acknowledged,
there's a chance that it will discourage them over the long term from
engaging and contributing further.

The second is engagement. I see this as very closely linked to the
acknowledgement I've just outlined, but perhaps more active and more
"indiscriminate". Whereas I framed acknowledgement in the context of a
direct conversation, say, a question and answer thread between a couple
of Community members, engagement is the collective and open set of
actions available to us all, whether we're in a particular conversation
or not.

The current incarnation of the online SAP Community affords us different
ways to engage. At the macro level, there are activities such as sharing
thoughts and knowledge in [blog posts](https://blogs.sap.com/). Asking
questions and providing answers in
[Q&A](https://answers.sap.com/index.html).

At the micro level, there are simple actions that cost only a second,
but all add up. If you read a blog post that you enjoyed, you can
"like" it (with a button at the top of the post). Similarly, you can
"like" a comment to a post. In the Q&A area, there are comments as
well as answers, and you can "like" a comment there too, as well as
upvote an answer. You can also downvote an answer; don't be afraid to
do so if you think that's the right thing to do - but consider adding a
comment explaining the downvote, so the recipient understands why.

There's also a level in between, a level where I'd place engagement
actions such as making comments on blog posts or in Q&A.

There are many folks that engage like this as a matter of course, and I
take my hat off to them. While the SAP Community platform software is
the base, it's the people who are the living, breathing spirit, and I
think there's a balance that we need to try and maintain - encouraging
these people to continue to engage, and welcoming & encouraging net
newcomers too.

I've resolved to try my best to do my part. To acknowledge, to engage,
to be polite, and show manners. All that is in my gift. That's what
keeps communities going - acting by example. I hope you'll join me.

This post was brought to you by the sunrise over the SAP mothership in
Walldorf, and some OK tasting coffee from the breakfast area in the
hotel. Definitely OK enough for me to want another cup.
