*We got together to build a Developer Keynote for TechEd for you; this
post gives you some context on what you'll see, and, following the
keynote, will contain all the links you need.*

**Update 10 Dec 2020: Watch the Developer Keynote replay here â˜ž
[Developer Keynote: All Developers
Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btEk_jdQo6A) and get access to
the code and config in the GitHub repo, now public:
<https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote>.**

All the developer advocates are looking forward to SAP TechEd 2020. Some
of us are giving individual sessions, but we all got together to build
the [DK100 Developer Keynote](https://bit.ly/teched-dk100), which is
open to everyone, scheduled a couple of times to suit different
timezones, and is hopefully enlightening and fun. Go ahead and [add it
to your agenda](https://bit.ly/teched-dk100) and then come back here and
continue reading ðŸ™‚

### The story

The theme and tagline of the Developer Keynote is "All Developers
Welcome", and the story is of three developers, with completely
different backgrounds and skillsets, coming together on their first
project sprint review, to look at where they are, and to explain to each
other the components that each of them have been building.

The company they work for initiated this "Charity Fund" project which
is all about building charity fund credit amounts in a backend ABAP
system based on sales orders, and their values, coming into their main
ERP system on SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Those charity fund credits will go
towards a tree-planting initiative later that year.

Tasked with building different parts to the whole solution, the
developers have come together in this first sprint review to go through
what they've done, and how they've done it. Here you'll see multiple
components work together \...

-   across different runtimes on SAP Cloud Platform (Kyma, Cloud Foundry
    and ABAP)
-   in different languages (ABAP, Go, Node.js and Bash)
-   using different programming models (SAP Cloud Application
    Programming Model and ABAP's RESTful Application Programming Model)
-   in different time signatures (synchronous and asynchronous using SAP
    Enterprise Messaging)
-   for different purposes (backend services and a frontend with SAP UI5
    & SAP Fiori)
-   based on standardised APIs and Cloud Events (from the SAP API
    Business Hub)


but with one overarching theme - ALL of these three DEVELOPERS, with
different backgrounds and skillsets, are WELCOME.

The sprint review is oriented around the project team's whiteboard,
which looks like this:

### Where you fit in

Perhaps you can identify with one or more of these developer skillsets
or backgrounds. Perhaps this will inspire you to try out that little
idea you've been hatching, or to dig in to that tutorial you've
promised yourself. Perhaps it will at least show that multi-discipline
projects are tangible and within your reach.

Perhaps most importantly, everything you see that the developers have
built, is available for you to try out yourself, in an SAP Cloud
Platform trial account. All the code and configuration that the
developer advocates collectively created, and that was shown in the
keynote, [is available in a public GitHub repository for you to clone,
try out and
adapt](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote).

So enjoy the [Developer Keynote
replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btEk_jdQo6A), have fun digging
into the code, and most of all, remember:

ALL DEVELOPERS WELCOME!
