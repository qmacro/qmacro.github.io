*I'll be watching all the Channel 1 content as it happens from the
comfort of my TV - as well as interacting with individual sessions on my
computer. Here's how.*

Next week's SAP TechEd is almost upon us, and I'm looking forward to
it, especially Channel 1, which you can learn more about in [today's
episode of SAP Developer
News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oasv3iBwyqc).

While I'll be interacting with individual sessions on my computer via
the [main SAP TechEd
website](https://pages.sapteched.com/sap/sapteched2020/index) I'm going
to take advantage of the fact that the entire Channel 1 stream is going
to be broadcast as a Twitter Live Event too, at this URL:

☞ <https://twitter.com/i/events/1328768348725776384/>

And best of all, it's ungated, i.e. you don't have to log on to
anything to watch it!

So I'm going to set a Chrome browser tab up pointing to that Twitter
Live Event URL, and then cast it to my TV via the power of
[Chromecast](https://store.google.com/gb/product/chromecast).

_Chromecasting Channel 1 to my TV_

That way I can enjoy the continuous content that Channel 1 will be
offering \-- learning from the hosts, moderators, guests & presenters in
Keynote, Executive live Q&A, Strategy Talk and Live Interview
sessions\* \-- as the sessions play out.

\*you *have* registered for the [Developer
Keynote](/blog/posts/2020/11/19/sap-teched-developer-keynote-dk100-the-story/),
right?

Anyway, let me know how you're going to watch Channel 1 on the [Twitter
Live Event stream](https://twitter.com/i/events/1328768348725776384/).
On the main living room TV? Audio only via your phone while walking?
Something else? Let me know!
