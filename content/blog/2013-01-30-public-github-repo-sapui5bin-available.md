Recently I've found myself making references to a small but growing collection of runnable SAPUI5 snippets that I've been collecting together, called "sapui5bin". It started from early discussions in this space on SCN, and I thought I'd try and capture the "executable output" of those discussions, blog posts and so on.

Here's a few examples of the bits and pieces that are contained in this repo:

* from my blog post "[Jump to Shell Workset Item from URL](/blog/posts/2013/01/11/jump-to-shell-workset-item-from-url/)" we have an example of URL-based Shell workset item navigation, improved upon by [John Patterson](http://scn.sap.com/people/john.patterson)
* from a discussion with [Andreas Kunz](http://scn.sap.com/people/andreas.kunz) we have a snippet that shows how to bind a Paginator control to a model
* from a YouTube video I recorded - "[Re-presenting my site with SAPUI5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZUXz5f1CHI)" - we have an MVC style collection of code ([blogui](https://github.com/qmacro/sapui5bin/tree/master/blogui))
* [conditional data binding](https://answers.sap.com/questions/9305586/conditional-data-binding.html) from an early discussion in this space
* [John Patterson](http://scn.sap.com/people/john.patterson) has kindly sent me a pull request (which I accepted and which he's subsequently updated) which represents an "[OData Cart](https://github.com/qmacro/sapui5bin/tree/master/ODATA_cart)"

Please have a browse, clone the repository, try the examples and snippets out, and feel free to contribute too!
