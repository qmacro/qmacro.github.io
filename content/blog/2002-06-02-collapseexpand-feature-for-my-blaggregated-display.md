title: Collapse/Expand feature for my Blaggregated display
description: Extending Blagg and related features.

Marc Barrot’s weblog, [‘slam’](http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/), has some great collapse/expand features for the display of his items. I’ve adopted his idea, using his [javascript](https://web.archive.org/web/20051218025205/http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/js/outliner.js), to make the display of my “[Morning Reading](/cgi-bin/blosxom/djnews)” neater and more manageable. Thanks Marc! I created a [very simple plugin](https://web.archive.org/web/20060105094402/http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/f-title.pl) for [Blagg](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blagg) to format the titles of the items slightly differently (now they contain the source feed’s title in the item title, so I can see in the collapsed mode where each item is sourced).
