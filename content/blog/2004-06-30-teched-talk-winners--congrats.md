description: Congratulations to the three TechEd talk winners Luke, Jayakumar and Andreas.

The winning talks look really good â€“ Iâ€™m looking forward to hearing them. Itâ€™s interesting that two of the three are BW related. Seems like a hot topic.

I wonder if TechEd will offer some [birds of a feather](https://web.archive.org/web/20040613191559/http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/29/bof.html) (BOF) style facilities? If there are such facilities, perhaps some of the rest of us can get together informally during TechEd and inflict our talks on each other anyway ðŸ˜‰
