description: A positive review of my O'Reilly book.

Cool, [my book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596002025/ "Programming Jabber at Amazon") gets a nice review over at [IBM DeveloperWorks](https://web.archive.org/web/20021220080946/http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-jabberbk/index.html?loc=dwmain).

It’s been about a year now since I originally started researching and writing it; I’d taken a few months off work to devote time to it. It sure was a fun, but intense, time. I can appreciate much more now just how much work goes into writing a technical title, and I re-read books on my bookshelves with awe anew.
