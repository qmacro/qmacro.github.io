On [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs) there's a new [2024 thread on battlestations](https://lobste.rs/s/jrh1od/lobsters_battlestations_screenshots) where folks share pics of their desk setups. So I thought I'd share a pic of mine.

It's in the office space on the narrowboat that you can see here near the centre of the cabin (from the post [Working from a narrowboat - Internet connectivity](/blog/posts/2023/01/09/working-from-a-narrowboat-internet-connectivity/)):

My main work machine is a MacBook Air M2 from 2022, which is great. I'm running the Chromebook tablet (Lenovo IdeaPad Duet 3) to monitor Docker containers (via a remote ssh-based context, in a similar way to how I set up [remote access to Docker on my Synology NAS](/blog/posts/2021/06/12/remote-access-to-docker-on-my-synology-nas/)) and also I use it for controlling my live streams via YouTube Studio, where I can monitor the chat separate from my main display.

The space is perfect, and just behind the wooden bulkhead is the [stove](/blog/posts/2023/04/07/living-on-a-narrowboat-the-stove-as-the-heart-of-the-home/), so it's nice and warm here in the office as well as in the saloon and galley.
