I'm delivering and / or involved in various in-person talks and workshops over the next few months, here's a quick breakdown.

### 26 Sep: Foundations of AI applications with the SAP HANA Cloud

This is an SAP CodeJam [on Fri 26 Sep in Porto, PT](https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/foundations-of-ai-applications-with-the-sap-hana-cloud-porto-pt/ev-p/14153367), led by my lovely colleague Witalij Rudnicki and assisted by me.

### 27 Sep: Level up your CAP skills by learning how to use the cds REPL

This is a talk I'm giving on Sat 27 Sep at [SAP Inside Track Porto](https://sitporto.com), PT, following the AI and SAP HANA Cloud CodeJam the day before.

Abstract: The cds repl (REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop) is an extremely powerful and versatile tool for every CAP Node.js developer. In this session, you'll become acquainted with it, get a feel for what it's like, how to wield its powers, and more. No experience required, this will be a live session with no slides.

### 08 Oct: SAP Fiori elements flexible programming model

This is an SAP CodeJam [on Wed 08 Oct in Birmingham, UK](https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/sap-fiori-elements-flexible-programming-model-birmingham-uk/ev-p/14210332), led by my lovely colleague Nico Schoenteich and assisted by me.

### 10 Oct: Service integration with SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

This is an SAP CodeJam [on Fri 10 Oct in Munich, DE](https://community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam/service-integration-with-the-sap-cloud-application-programming-model-munich/ec-p/14212922), led by me.

### 11 Oct: CAP Node.js features for local development

This is a talk on Sat 11 Oct at [SAP Inside Track Munich](https://community.sap.com/t5/m%C3%BCnchen-blog-posts/sap-inside-track-munich-2025-call-for-speakers-sitmuc25/ba-p/14161947) DE, following the CAP CodeJam the day before.

Abstract: There are some great facilities in CAP Node.js for local development, which means rapid iterations and the ability to think local-first without losing sight of the productive context in the cloud. In this session I'll demonstrate some of these facilities which will make you a valuable asset to any project. No slides, just working live in the terminal and editor.

### 05 Nov: Draft day for developers: Turning new technology into real-world wins

I'll [be at SAP TechEd](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/speaker-catalog-inperson/page/dj-adams), and I'm honoured to play a part in session [KEY101 | Draft day for developers: Turning new technology into real-world wins](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/berlin/flow/sap/te25/catalog-inperson/page/catalog/session/1755789361320001c3gG), the Developer Keynote on Wed 05 Nov at SAP TechEd in Berlin this year.

Abstract: The picks are in, and developers, their tools, and frameworks are first-round talent. Get a front-row seat to SAP's latest innovations built to accelerate how you code, automate, and scale. Explore how you can use SAP's newest AI capabilities, generative agents, and enhanced tooling to build faster and smarter with less friction and more impact.

### 05 Nov: Trivia competition

Abstract: Work through a simple SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) project, live with your peers, in the cds REPL. Explore as you go and collectively ask each other questions, such as "What will happen if?" "What do you think this will evaluate to?" and "Why does this happen?"

### 30 Nov: Hands-on workshop

I'm _hoping_ to be able to attend and deliver some sort of hands-on workshop at [UKISUG Connect](https://www.sap.com/uk/events/2025-11-30-uk-pe-ukisug-connect.html) this year on Sun 30 Nov in Birmingham, UK. Nothing has been confirmed or agreed yet, but I thought I'd put it in this list, and cross my fingers :-)
