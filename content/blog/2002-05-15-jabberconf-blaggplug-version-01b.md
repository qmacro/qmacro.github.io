I’ve just updated the ‘[jabberconf](https://web.archive.org/web/20060105094402/http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/jabberconf.pl)‘ [Blaggplug](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blagg/#blaggplugs) from 0+1 to **0+1b**. This new version escapes the entities transferred as text to the Jabber conference room, stopping any XML-related chundering on Jabber’s part.
