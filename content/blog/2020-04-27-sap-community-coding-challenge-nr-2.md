Welcome to the second challenge in the **SAP Community Coding Challenge
Series**. Just like the [first
challenge](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/02/28/sap-community-coding-challenge-series/),
we have a puzzle for you to solve. Again, something fun and simple
enough to solve in a reasonably short period of time.

(The deadline for this challenge has now passed - for an update, please
read [SAP Community Coding Challenge 2 --
Update](/blog/posts/2020/05/26/sap-community-coding-challenge-2-update/).)

For this second challenge we take a short departure from our technology
roots towards where many of us are already heading (and indeed many of
us are already there in some shape or form). And that is the age of Web
application UIs and cloud based backend services.

If there's one language that joins both of these worlds together, it's
JavaScript, in its two main incarnations - Web browser based, and
server-side in the form of Node.js. The [SAP
Fiori](https://www.sap.com/uk/products/fiori.html) world is facilitated
by the fantastic [UI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/) engine which
is powered by JavaScript. Backend services in the [SAP Cloud Platform
Cloud Foundry
environment](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-fundamentals.html)
can be written in many languages, and a popular one is indeed JavaScript
(Node.js). The [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model
(CAP)](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/10/10/application-programming-model-start-here/)
supports both Java and JavaScript for your custom logic. Even the
[Script Tasks in Workflow
definitions](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/26/discovering-scp-workflow-script-tasks/)
on SAP Cloud Platform are written in JavaScript.

So what are you waiting for? Dive in, the water's lovely!

## Challenge Directions

<a name="problem"></a>
Just like the first challenge, there are certain requirements that have
to be met. First, there's a specific problem to be solved. And that is
the [Longest Collatz sequence](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)
problem from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) archives,
which is this:

The [Collatz
conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a
fascinating one, and with a few lines of code we are able to explore it,
in the form of this Project Euler problem, in our challenge series.

<a name="requirements"></a>
Here are the requirements for your solution:

-   it must produce the correct answer (according to Project Euler) in
    the form of a single integer value
-   it must be written in JavaScript
-   it must be provided in the form of a link to your code, somewhere on
    the web, preferably in a runnable form\*
-   that link must also show not only the code but the answer as well


*\*see the Sharing Your Solution section below*

While of course your solution will only be considered if it meets the
above requirements, the judging will be based on subjective matters.
It's up to you how you want to play that. Here are some example
considerations with respect to the code you provide (but there are
almost certainly going to be others too):

-   does it nicely demonstrate a certain style of programming (OO, FP,
    imperative, etc)?
-   does it make use of libraries, and if so, in what way and with what
    advantages or disadvantages?
-   how short and succinct is it? How short is too short? How long is
    too long?
-   what's your take on whitespace?
-   how easy is it to read, understand and / or modify?
-   what strategy did you take with respect to variables and their
    names?
-   how creative is the solution?

## Submission & Judging

Once you have a solution you are happy with, please do the following:

1. Follow this blog post (use the green "Follow" button at the top left of this page)
2. Email us at <community@sap.com> with the following:
    -   a link to your solution\* (do not send code or the answer in the email)
    -   a link to your public SAP Community profile

*\*see the Sharing Your Solution section below*

You have until the end of **Thu 14 May 2020** whenever that is in your
own timezone to send that email in. The community and SAP Developer
Advocates will then do the first round of judging to narrow the
solutions down to 5 finalists. Those finalist's solutions will be
posted in an SAP Community Q&A entry so that everyone will have a chance
to vote on the best overall solution.

And, just like the first challenge, the fabulous prize for the winner of
the Coding Challenge will be a
[No-Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_No-Prize). The coveted
No-Prize also comes as usual with the unending adulation & admiration of
the community of fellow developers.

```javascript
console.log('Good luck!')
```

## Sharing Your Solution

We are in the age of the Web as the true native platform and there are
many places on the Web to write and execute code, and make that publicly
available. We are not dictating any particular site, but can certainly
point you in the direction of a few:

-   [repl.it](https://repl.it)
-   [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/)
-   [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)

With any of these sites, you can create code and make the source
available, and also have it executable. These sites are great for what
you might need in this challenge (and there are others too).

If you prefer, you can instead share your solution (code & answer) here
on the SAP Community. Do this by creating a [new Coffee Corner
Discussion](https://answers.sap.com/articles/create.html) and make sure
that if you do, you use "CCC2" as the first word in the title, and
that you also use the "**code**" button (highlighted) to properly
format your code so that it's readable. Here's an example:

![](/images/2020/04/Screenshot-2020-04-16-at-18.46.32.png)

Either way, once you've added your solution, you should provide a link
to it (either to your code in one of the websites above or to your
Coffee Corner Discussion entry) in the email as described above.
