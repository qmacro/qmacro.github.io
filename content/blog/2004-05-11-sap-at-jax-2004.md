description: A brief report on JAX 2004.

My friend Matthew Langham [reports on SAP at JAX 2004 in Frankfurt](https://web.archive.org/web/20040818042907/http://www.silent-penguin.com/archives/001775.html) (Matthew is giving a total of three sessions at JAX). It’s not that SAP hasn’t had a presence at other non-SAP events before now; it’s just great to see that SAP is getting involved in the communities that support it.

Ivo Totev gave a keynote today: [SAP goes J2EE](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402155532/http://www.jax.de/konferenzen/psecom,id,180,nodeid,.html), and there are three other sessions from SAP people:

- Logging and Tracing in Big Applications (Martin Stein)
- Erstellung von Web-Applikationen auf Basis Service-orientierter Architekturen (Karin Schattka)
- JMX, Teil 1: Monitoring von J2EE-Applikationen (Gregor Frey)

I only wish I could have been there.

Nice one, folks!
