I use filters to manage my emails and auto-filter all incoming emails that have
me only in the CC list, and not in the TO list, into a separate folder. I
review emails in this folder no more frequently than every couple of days. This
is common practice.

If you’re emailing a group of people and addressing them directly in the body
of the email, you should think about making sure they’re in the TO list, not
just the CC list. It’s common courtesy, and also you’ll probably get a reply
quicker :-)
