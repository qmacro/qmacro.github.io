Itâ€™s in Ratingen (Duesseldorf), just around the corner â€“ literally, in fact â€“ from where I used to hack on R/2 at Mitsubishi.

As itâ€™s just down the road from me, I might go. Then again, how much of it is going to be yet more marketing of the NetWeaver flavour? You canâ€™t tell these days. Thereâ€™s an interesting couple of things on the agenda:

```text
13:30 Projekterfahrungen zum SAP Web AS
* Ein Bericht des SAP Consulting
```

and

```text
14:30 Live-PrÃ¤sentation
* Web-Entwicklung mit dem SAP Web AS unter Java und ABAP
```

so perhaps Iâ€™ll go just for the afternoon.

Now, if I can persuade my wife that itâ€™s worth the EUR 150 attendance fee theyâ€™re asking. Hmm, if I just go for the afternoon and miss the lunch, perhaps it would be less ðŸ˜‰
