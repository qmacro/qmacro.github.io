After Devtoberfest comes TechEd and the long tail of conferences that lead into
the holiday season. Then comes the new year, and a restart of our [long
running](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/hands-on-sap-dev-with-qmacro-new-live-stream-series/ba-p/13393464)
live stream show "Hands-on SAP Dev" on the [SAP Developers YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@sapdevs).

We're starting 2026 off with an under-the-hood style mini-series exploring
expressions in CDS.

- 16 Jan 2026 Part 1 - [Introduction and overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiE20i5BP70) (replay)
- 23 Jan 2026 Part 2 - [First CXL example expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4IZR1LBRrA) (upcoming)

It's all about CXL - the Core Expression Language. What's that? One of the mini
languages[<sup>1</sup>](#footnotes) in the CDS language family that is all
about expressions. Expressions are everywhere - they're used in queries, in
calculated elements and in annotations. They are fundamental to many of the
underlying design philosophies in CAP and convey power wrapped in simplicity
that is the hallmark of CDS.
