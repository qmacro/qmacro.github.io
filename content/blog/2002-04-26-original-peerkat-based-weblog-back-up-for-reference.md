Well, I got everything back in order relating to the old experimental weblog, and I’m running an instance of [Peerkat](https://web.archive.org/web/20020409124530/http://slim.oreillynet.com:6502/lang/python/peerkat/) to expose the blog data. It’s back at the same address (`http://www.pipetree.com:8080`) but is just for reference. I’m pressing forward with this new [Blosxom](https://web.archive.org/web/20020407234615/http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blosxom/)-based weblog.
