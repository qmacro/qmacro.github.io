*SAP TechEd 2020 is fast approaching, and in many ways it will be a
different experience for all of us. Then again, there's one thing that
will remain - and that's the dedication of those folks producing
content for us to share & enjoy. Here's what I'm looking forward to in
the rich array of sessions offered.*

I've looked through every session and I guess I can divide up my
personal picks into categories: baseline technologies with interesting
aspects and immediate application, sessions from folks that I know will
be engaging and inspirational, Channel 1 content, and what appeals to my
sense of what's important generally. In no particular order, here we
go!

## Channel 1 content

As well as more regular sessions this year, SAP TechEd features
"[Channel
1](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/1603826766209001dGtz)"
(find it on your [Attendee
Dashboard](https://reg.sapteched.com/flow/sap/sapteched2020/attendee-portal/page/portal)),
with a rolling flow of different content items. The Channel 1 hosts
include some of my advocate colleagues, and for that reason alone I'm
interested, but in particular, there are these sessions that I'm
looking forward to:

**[Presenting the Devtoberfest Finalists \[GS201\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1604670201406001rAkT)** -
presumably you've been following our [Devtoberfest 2020
event](https://github.com/sap-samples/sap-devtoberfest-2020), right? In
any case, why not check out this post from Tom to catch up and get
voting: [Devtoberfest Contest
Voting](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/09/devtoberfest-contest-voting/)
and then you're ready to join this Channel 1 session to check out all
the finalists.

**[Developer Keynote: All Developers Welcome \[DK100\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1603314875989001AsWU)**
(with Kevin Muessig, Rich Heilman and me, and background work from all
the Developer Advocates) - this for me is the most exciting session of
them all because I think it represents very well where we are from a
technology standpoint with SAP Cloud Platform, with different tools,
languages, runtimes and more. Additionally, everything you see in this
session is available for you to try out for free in your trial
accounts.

â˜ž There's a short overview of the keynote that I'd urge you to read
now - it will give you the background story and context to what goes on
in the session: [SAP TechEd Developer Keynote DK100 -- The Story](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/11/19/sap-teched-developer-keynote-dk100-the-story/).

I think there's something for everyone in this session - including a
cameo Vim appearance (see if you can spot it) and some Bash scripting.
All developers welcome! (Rich also has other sessions including one
below - [check them all out
here](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog?search=%22Rich%20Heilman%22).)

## My sense of what's important generally

Actually I made this category up just so I could include what is I know
going to be a session where I geek out the most.

**[Explore the New Capabilities of SAP Cloud Platform -- Open API and CLI \[DEV360\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555754690001uKl1)**
(an expert workshop by Michal Keidar and Segev Lev) - I've been known
to say, on occasion, "**The Future Is Terminal!**" and I mean it. Then
again, I've also been referred to as "that crazy TTY guy", and often
simply "that idiot". So what do I know?

Anyway, as we move forward further into the 21st century, one thing is
clear, that some technologies and approaches become more important than
ever, regardless of their age. In fact, longevity is a sign of
stability, reliability and suitability for the job. And for that reason,
this session on APIs and command line interface possibilities for SAP
Cloud Platform hits the bullseye for me. This session gets my special
"`>_`" badge that I just invented while writing this paragraph.

## Engaging and inspirational

I have the privilege of working alongside some wonderful people in the
Developer Advocates team, and interacting with equally wonderful people
in the wider ecosphere. I've attended sessions from all these folks
before and know that their TechEd sessions will not only be interesting
and important but also engaging.

**[Beyond SAPUI5 and SAP Fiori Elements \[IIS114\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555759653001u2p2)**
(a beginner breakout session by mariusobert) - I can't deny, I'm a big
fan of UI5, and since my time digging in, the world of UI5 and SAP UI in
general has grown. In this session we'll learn from Marius what there
is, and when to use what.

**[Build Data Pipelines with SAP Data Intelligence \[INT105\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555762554001uNVN)**
(a beginner lecture by Witalij Rudnicki) - Witalij is my go-to person
for all things data, and this session is going to be no exception. Just
like asynchronous processes are the life blood of the application level,
the data pipeline is the life blood of what supports those applications.
(Witalij also has another couple of sessions - [check them all out
here](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog?search=%22Witalij%20Rudnicki%22).)

**[Cloud-Native Development with SAP HANA \[DAT160\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555965285001RSkw)**
(a beginner workshop by thomas.jung and rich.heilman) - SAP Cloud
Application Programming Model (another love of mine), SAP HANA cloud
services and the SAP Business Application Studio? What's missing?
Nothing \... all that's needed is perhaps a dynamic duo to run the
workshop. Oh, wait! All sorted! (Thomas also has other sessions, [check
them all out here](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog?search=%22Thomas%20Jung%22).)

**[Transitioning from ABAP Programmer to Developer \[CM105\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1603734625163001mas9)**
(a Channel 1 Talk by Nabheet Madan3) - Nabheet has being putting out
some great content on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW8OSu54ONLbsdV30tB3sKQ),
helping ABAP programmers gain new skills. While ABAP is still a key
skill, there are plenty of other skills out there that are worth
learning \... but how? That's what this session is about.

## Baseline technologies

There's a lot of SAP tech we advocates have covered in the [Hands-on
SAP Dev
show](/blog/posts/2020/11/09/an-overview-of-sap-developers-video-content/)
over on the [SAP Developers YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sapdevs), and what's resonated
with me is what the SAP Cloud Platform (SCP) represents, plus the
breadth of facilities available. For that reason, I'm listing some
TechEd sessions here in this context:

**[Architecture Vision and Strategy Behind SAP's Business Technology Platform \[ST100\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1603382154712001ui1P)**
(a beginner strategy talk by Michael Ameling) - Starting off with a nice
high level overview of what I see as a functional layer atop of SCP,
important when we think of the intelligent suite as a whole.

**[Craft and Execute Your Enterprise API Strategy \[DEV114\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602217234696001KUtz)**
(a beginner breakout session by Soumyadeep Ganguly) - in various
Hands-on SAP Dev show sessions, we've come across and embraced all
kinds of APIs on SCP, plus made good use of the SAP API Business Hub. As
we start to properly understand and embrace the multiple components of
the intelligent enterprise it's important to have a good understanding
of how to use and manage their most fundamental and important assets -
their programming interfaces.

**[Event-Driven Integrations Using SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite \[DEV216\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/1602555753977001u2xH)**
(an advanced breakout session by Sunny Kapoor) - the author [William
Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson) once said "The
future is here, it's just not evenly distributed". In a way, that
reminds me of our future, which to a large extent is also uneven, at
least in a time context. In other words, our future is **asynchronous**.
Event-driven systems have been around for decades, and the concepts are
now being applied to the enterprise in a big way. We have seen some of
that in our [Diving into messaging on SAP Cloud
Platform](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RpkC85SLQCf--P9o7DtfjEcucimapUf)
series.

## Wrapping up

Actually, I do have one more session that I'm definitely putting into
my agenda, and that's this one:

**[SAP TechEd Wrap-Up and Live Q&A \[EQA101\]](https://events.sapteched.com/widget/sap/sapteched2020/Catalog/session/16033147247400012BLW)**
(an executive Q&A session with Juergen Mueller, Thomas Grassl and
Thomas Jung). Three big thinkers together in one place, helping us to
digest SAP TechEd 2020, with the bonus of us being able to ask
questions. What's not to like?

So there you go - that's what I'm looking forward to at SAP TechEd
2020. How about you?
