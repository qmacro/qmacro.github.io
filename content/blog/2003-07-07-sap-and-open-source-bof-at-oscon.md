If youâ€™re at OSCON or around the Portland area this Wednesday (9th July), come along to the [SAP and Open Source BOF](https://web.archive.org/web/20031018005002/http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/4565) to chat with SAP and Open Source hackers about where the crossovers between the two worlds are.

Beer may be involved, too!
