I’ve written [a post](/blog/posts/2005/04/19/sdn-meets-labs/) on my weblog that I uploaded during the Keynote by Klaus Kreplin and Ivo Totev (Ivo’s just telling us about visual composer, demonstrating it in Internet Explorer. Does it work in standards-compliant browsers too, I wonder?)  The post contains a link to the SDN Flickr group where I’ve also uploaded photos from today (mostly registration, so far), and I’m sure other attendees will be uploading photos there too.  Ok, off to cast a critical eye over what’s being demonstrated.
