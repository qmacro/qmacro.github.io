Piers and I got hold of the latest WAS 6.40 demo system (NW4) from the [LinuxLab](http://www.sap.com/linux) guysâ€™ stand here at SAP TechEd. It contains ABAP service pack 3 and Java/J2EE service pack 7.

Since I had my small Linux server with me (that I used in my session this morning to demo some ICF stuff), we decided to blast away the previous NW4 install and have a mini installfest!

Excellent. Thereâ€™s something about interesting things happening on computer screens that seem to attract the inner-geek in people â€¦ within minutes we had a small crowd of people joining Piers, Mark, Gregor and me to watch the poor little server get hammered as the RPMs were installed from the DVD.

Iâ€™m typing this post while the install goes on â€“ here you can see a screenshot of the progress.

## Small hack needed

I noticed straight away that the install.sh script supplied on the DVD crashed and burned immediately. I had a little look (open source rules again ðŸ™‚) and found it was because the script was trying to execute a KDE program â€˜kdialogâ€™ to display the licence and prompt for acceptance of the terms. (KDE is a desktop manager). I donâ€™t have KDE installed on the server, so it was almost a non-starter.

Luckily I had a flash of inspiration, and created a symbolic link from a non-existent â€˜kdialogâ€™ to the ever-present X client utility â€˜xmessageâ€™ (I avoided copy-and-editing the script from the DVD as I would have had to change loads of relative pathnames and so on to get it to work from a new location). I reinvoked the install.sh script â€¦ and everything started perfectly. Hurrah! (If you look closely at the screenshot you can see evidence of this little hack.)

Anyway, 4 RPMs have been installed by now â€“ itâ€™s time for me to go back and have a look.

## Update: Install complete

Ok, after less than two hours, my new NW4 system, service release one, is installed and up and running:

Nice work, LinuxLab folks!
