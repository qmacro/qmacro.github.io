The Business Rules service is available on the SAP Cloud Platform (SCP)
and is categorised within the "Integration" section, along with other
services such as the Workflow service, and in fact the two services
complement each other very well - I like to think of them as siblings.

Last week I was honoured to appear [as a guest on the SAP CodeTalk series
hosted by Ian Thain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pLz7xCXPHM) and the subject was the Business Rules service.

I thought it would be useful to gather together a few links to help get
you started on your journey of discovery.

You should absolutely visit the main [Business Rules landing page in
help.sap.com](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/BUSINESS_RULES) because it
contains pointers to key resources such as the core documentation, the
API documentation on the SAP API Hub, and a "what's new" section.

Murali Shanmugham has a nice multi-part series on combining
Workflow and Business Rules in an example scenario: [Implementing a user
self-registration scenario using Workflow and Business rules in SAP
Cloud
Platform](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/07/31/implementing-a-user-self-registration-scenario-using-workflow-and-business-rules-in-sap-cloud-platform-part-1/)

Archana Shukla has written a number of useful posts on the Business
Rules service - definitely worth having a browse through these.

The Business Rules service was first available in SCP's Neo
environment - it's now also available in the trial landscape of the
Cloud Foundry (CF) environment. This in itself is interesting as it's a
pattern that we could see more often. It's also a good way to start
understanding more about the CF environment, as you have something
similar to compare and contrast across the two different environments.
See Archana's post for more info: [Quick Start Guide to SAP Cloud
Platform Business Rules Service in Cloud
Foundry](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/29/quick-start-guide-to-sap-business-rules-service-in-cloud-foundry/).

As I mentioned in the video, there's a library of controls in UI5 for
Business Rules - you can find them in the API reference here:
[sap.rules.ui](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/api/sap.rules.ui).
There's also a related tutorial available in the UI5 SDK (something
I've only just discovered!) which is here: [Rule Builder
Control](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/67fcb301d0504fd4a24915edf4058c51) where
you can learn how to embed a rule builder control into your
application.

And last but not least, there's a tag here in the SAP Community that
you can follow, to see [Business Rules
Q&A](https://answers.sap.com/tags/73554900100800000842) and [blog post
content](https://blogs.sap.com/tags/73554900100800000842/).

Happy Business Ruling!
