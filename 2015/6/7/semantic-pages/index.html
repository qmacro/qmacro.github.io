<p><strong><a href="/2015/07/04/30-days-of-ui5/">30 Days of UI5</a>  — Day 3 by <a href="//qmacro.org/about/">DJ Adams</a></strong></p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2018/01/download1-1.jpeg" alt="image">](http:/www.bloomsbury.com/au/primer-of-greek-grammar-9780715612583/)</p>
<p>(This book was a close companion in an earlier life.)</p>
<p>My degree in Latin and Greek is not entirely without foundation or reason, and it provides me with at least a small sense of origin when it comes to words. The 3rd declension noun <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%83%E1%BF%86%CE%BC%CE%B1">σῆμα</a> conveys the idea of a mark, a sign, a token. It refers to “meaning”, essentially, and the use in modern languages of the word semantic often implies an abstraction, a layer that confers or allows meaning to be defined or carried.</p>
<p>What has that got to do with UI5 reaching release 1.30? Well, take a look at the fledgling <a href="https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/entity/sap.m.semantic.SemanticPage/samples">Semantic Page</a>. It’s the root of a series of new controls that are perhaps set to encourage standardisation of Fiori UIs. The <a href="http://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/">SAP Fiori Design Guidelines</a> describe a rich set of controls, but more importantly they describe how those controls should be typically employed.</p>
<p>Floorplans such as the <a href="http://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/floorplans/split-screen/">Split Screen Layout</a> and the <a href="http://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/floorplans/full-screen/">Full Screen</a> are all fairly familiar to us. But consistency comes from attention to a more granular level of detail, and the UI designers are encouraged to place certain controls in standard places. A couple of examples: Action buttons belong in the bottom right (in the footer) of a page, while the new <a href="https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/entity/sap.m.MessagePopover/samples">Message Popover</a> from 1.28 belongs in the bottom left.</p>
<p>When SAP created Fiori application developer teams across the world to build out <a href="fioriappslibrary.hana.ondemand.com/sap/fix/externalViewer/">the Fiori apps that we see available today</a>, it was almost inevitable that the different styles and approaches across teams and members would have resulted in a variety of structures, making it difficult to get the UX right, the UI consistent, and causing maintenance headaches. So SAP created scaffolding (sap.ca.scfld), a set of mechanisms that abstracted away a lot of the common boilerplate stuff allowing the developers to focus on the application logic (and preventing them from reinventing the boilerplate, slightly differently, every time). But this scaffolding was a little bit too monolithic, and I think the plan has been to phase it out.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking that the alternative could involve this set of semantic controls. Take a look at the way the <a href="https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.SemanticPage/preview">Semantic Page Master-Detail sample</a> puts things in the appropriate place – at a semantically meaningful level of abstraction above the individual mechanics of a Page control’s aggregations, for example.</p>
<p>It’s similar in the <a href="https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen/preview">Semantic Page Full Screen sample</a> too. To get a feel for this level of abstraction, <a href="https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/explored.html#/sample/sap.m.sample.SemanticPageFullScreen/code">take a look</a> at how the aggregations are filled – nowhere in this XML view definition does it say <em>where</em> the semantic controls should go:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/img/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2015-07-05-at-20.57.35.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What we seem to have so far is a small hierarchy of Page based controls, that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>     SemanticPage 
          | 
    +----------------------+
    |                      | 
MasterPage          ShareMenuPage
                           |
                   +---------------+
                   |               |
               DetailPage    FullscreenPage
</code></pre>
<p>And there are <a href="https://openui5beta.hana.ondemand.com/index.html#docs/api/symbols/sap.m.semantic.html">plenty of semantic controls too</a>. It doesn’t replace the breadth of functionality that the scaffolding offered, but it’s a start, and it feels more modular. A namespace to watch!</p>
