<p>Cloud computing, virtual machines. It’s big business. Amazon has its <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (EC2) which provides “<em>resizable compute capacity in the cloud</em>“, Microsoft has <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx">Azure</a>, providing “<em>on-demand compute and storage to host, scale, and manage Web applications on the Internet</em>” and Google’s offering is <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> which offers “<em>the ability to build and host web applications on <em>Google’s</em> infrastructure</em>“. As you might know, I’m personally very <a href="/tag/appengine/">taken with</a> App Engine.</p>
<p>The offerings are slightly different – for example, while EC2 is bare virtual hardware, App Engine is a web application platform in the cloud. But they all have similar pricing arrangements, based generally on uptime or CPU time, I/O  and storage.</p>
<p>Does this seem familiar to you? It does to me, but then again, I did just turn 0x2B this month. In 1988 I was working in the Database Support Group at a major energy company in London, looking after the SAP R/2 databases, which were powered by IMS DB/DC, on MVS – yes, IBM big iron mainframes. I still look back on those days with <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/11/burn-in-7-dj-adams.html">fond memories</a>.</p>
<p>In reviewing some 3rd party software, I wrote a document entitled “<strong>BMC Software’s Image Copy Plus: An Evaluation</strong>“. BMC’s Image Copy Plus was a product which offered faster image copies of our IMS DB (VSAM) databases. (Image Copy Plus, as well as IMS, is <a href="http://www.bmc.com/products/product-listing/23026-2064-1201.html">still around</a>, over 20 years on! But that has to be the subject of another post).</p>
<p>One of the sections of the evaluation was to compare costs, as well as time — by how much would the backup costs be reduced using BMC’s offering?</p>
<p>And have a guess on what the cost comparison was based? Yes. CPU time, I/O (disk and tape <a href="http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/EXCP">EXCP</a>s) and actual tapes.</p>
