      <h1>More thoughts on HTTP, Email, and Jabber</h1>

<time datetime="2002-05-21">21 May 2002</time>

<p>Since writing the previous entry, some more thoughts have drawn themselves to my attention. There are advantages that HTTP does have over email. Built-in authentication for one thing. I’ve only used basic authentication, but what about digest? Moreover, <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> goes one better and has a framework for identity.</p>
<p>Actually, talking about HTTP headers with basic and digest authentication, here’s something else I’ve been wondering. <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2002/05/19.html#a528">Simon Fell rightly suggests</a> using a more polite and sensitive way to grab RSS sources, by use of the Etag and If-Not-Match headers. Very sensible. But what about the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.25">If-Modified-Since</a> header?</p>
<p>Here’s one advantage that email has over HTTP. A built-in queueing system. Ok, the actual queueing system is made most visible by use of email clients, where you see mails in a queue, ready to read or process. But this is just a mask over the flat stack of emails that you can pop with, er, the POP protocol.</p>
<p>“Yesbut”, as a friend used to say in meetings and discussions. Here’s something I’ve been pondering too. Last week I downloaded and installed the fabulous <a href="http://www.fsck.com/projects/rt">RT</a>, (“Request Tracker”) – a ticketing system written in Perl. It’s <em>very</em> flexible and extensible. RT allows tickets to be managed in queues. It also allows tickets to be created (or corresponded upon) through different interfaces – via a web interface, via email, or via the command line. Any incoming transaction is inserted into a queue (if it’s a new ticket) or appended to an existing queue entry (if it’s correspondence on an existing ticket). I wonder if I can build a small front end to accept HTTP-based business calls and stick them in an RT queue? Of course, I also wonder whether that would be useful, but if nothing else, it would be stimulating.</p>
