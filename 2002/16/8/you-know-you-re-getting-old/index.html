<p>…when it takes you over two weeks to recover from <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2002/" title="Open Source Convention home page">OSCON</a>. What with the travel (ok, including a connectionless week in Manchester visiting relatives), the email backlog, and the catch-up at work, not to mention the overwhelming saturation of information, ideas, inspiration, and other things beginning with ‘i’ that came from the great time that was OSCON, I really need a post-conference holiday. I can’t begin to imagine what the organisers feel like.</p>
<p>It was as much the opportunities to meet and chat with other like-minded individuals, exchange thoughts and ideas, and generally make new friends, as it was the talks and tutorials that I (and probably many other attendees) valued there.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I also grabbed the chance to take my annual fill of U.S. food – chilli dogs, cheese fries, burritos, and cinnamon and raisin bagels. Yum.</p>
