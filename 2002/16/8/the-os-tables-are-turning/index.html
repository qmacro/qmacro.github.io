<p>I recently bought a <a href="http://www.focilux.be/Merken/M_Hama.htm" title="picture of the Hama 46594">Hama multi-slot card reader</a>, primarily for reading the Smart Media cards used in our camera. It came with software for Windows. I installed it on our Windows 98 machine, and plugged in the device, following the instructions to the letter. Ka-boom! Blue screen. After about an hour of trying and retrying to make it work (even installing upgraded drivers for the VIA chipset as recommended in the troubleshooting section), I was still no further on. Plugging in the device crashed Windows. Period.</p>
<p>About to package the thing up to take it back, I passed the house server running Linux. What the heck, I thought, and plugged it in the back. “Ooh, hello”, said the kernel. I mounted the emulated SCSI device, and grabbed the pictures of the Smart Media card. Easy as that.</p>
<p>The tables have turned. In times past, it used to be that peripherals Just Worked with Windows (mostly because the vendors targeted the drivers to that platform). Not any more.</p>
<p>I’m a happy Linux user.</p>
