      <h1>For REST, read &#39;Architectural Style&#39;</h1>

<p>In the swirling mass of memes surrounding web services (whatever they are) it’s sometimes easy to forget that <a href="http://internet.conveyor.com/RESTwiki/moin.cgi/FrontPage" title="The REST Wiki's front page">REST</a> is an architectural style, an approach, rather than something that you install or debug. If nothing else, it’s become useful as a framework in which I can think more clearly about web-based projects and their interfaces. Thinking in terms of a limited number of verbs (methods) with well-defined and widely understood semantics, combined with a set of ‘objects’ (represented by URIs) certainly helped me come up with a clear idea of what I should code, and how it should appear to the outside world, in a couple of recent projects.</p>
<p>What’s really interesting is that a pattern is emerging. The interface description table in my ‘working notes’ (aka final documentation :-) that I’ve written to describe the details of the latest project bear a remarkable resemblance to the table in the <a href="/space/RtRest">RESTful RT experiment</a> and also the one in <a href="http://www.bitworking.org/">Joe</a>‘s <a href="http://wellformedweb.org/RESTLog.cgi/5">RESTlog interface</a>. For each interaction, they each roughly show:</p>
<ul>
<li>the HTTP verb</li>
<li>the URI</li>
<li>what the payload to be sent is (and its content-type) if any</li>
<li>what the expected response is (HTTP status and pertinent headers)</li>
<li>what the payload to be expected back is (and its content-type) if any</li>
<li>what possible error responses there might be</li>
</ul>
<p>Incidentally, <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/">Piers</a> (my partner in code crime) has just written about the <a href="http://www.piersharding.com/article.xml?mhttp">client-end</a> of one of the RESTful projects at work.</p>
<p>I discovered a nice RESTful bonus when doing the documentation too – I could link directly to the URLs of some of the services from within my (HTML/Wiki-based) documentation, to show examples. That’s turning out to be very useful.</p>
