[Event info](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/03/21/sitsyd-sap-tech-night-sydney-april-20th-2022/) | [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2NKhW2z9eg)

As a developer with access to SAP’s Business Technology Platform, I already have free access to multiple runtime environments and services. These environments include Kubernetes, via Kyma, and Cloud Foundry.

While exploring service brokers and service consumption on SAP Business Technology Platform recently, with a view to understanding the context and role of the SAP Service Manager (another open source project in the form of Peripli), I wanted to go beyond the developer level access I had to a Cloud Foundry runtime.

In essence, I wanted my own Cloud Foundry environment instance, that I controlled and administered. That way I would be able to explore the SAP Service Manager, and service catalogues and marketplaces in general, in more detail.

But now you want to get to the next level to understand and manage your resources efficiently, aligned with the rest of your devops workflows. In this session -- which sits at the meeting point between developers, devops, developer experience and the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) - you'll learn what resources there are to manage, and how to manage them with powerful tools that you can build into automated mechanisms. The command line tools and APIs are where the rubber meets the road, and you need to be in the driving seat.

You'll come away with an understanding of what tools are available, what they're used for and where to use them. You'll also learn how to combine them with tools in the wider ecosphere to help you explore, create and manipulate resources on SAP BTP. If you're interested in levelling up in this space, and embracing command line tools and APIs that give you superpowers for your SAP BTP environment, this session is for you.
