I'm a [Developer Advocate at SAP](https://developers.sap.com/developer-advocates.html). I've been hacking on SAP enterprise software for more than three decades, and am still enjoying it. I created the first online SAP community in 1995, and in 2003 I co-created what is now known today as [SAP Community](https://community.sap.com).

I've been a member of SAP's [Mentors Advisory Board](http://web.archive.org/web/20170910073813/https://blogs.sap.com/2016/03/08/introducing-the-new-sap-mentors-advisory-board-2016-2018/), and also a member of SAP's Developer Advisory Board.

I've contributed to the [SAP](http://community.sap.com), [Perl](http://search.cpan.org/~qmacro/), [XMPP (Jabber)](http://xmpp.org) and [Google](http://gtugs.org) developer communities and was made an [SAP Mentor](http://www.sap.com/uk/community/resources/influencer-programs.html) in recognition of my contributions to the [SAP Developer Network (now "SAP Community")](http://community.sap.com).

I have spent many happy hours teaching kids & teachers to code. I ran a [CodeClub](/blog/posts/2013/04/18/codeclub-thoughts/) in my local village school, I've been a volunteer at [Manchester CoderDojo](http://mcrcoderdojo.org.uk), a STEMnet Ambassador and in 2013 I ran a centre in Manchester for [Young Rewired State](http://getcodingkids.com/young-rewired-state/).

I gave a talk on teaching kids to code, and why it's important, at TEDx Oldham. There's a recording here: [Our computational future: DJ Adams at TEDx Oldham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvOCaExeK0).

I have a wonderful son Joseph, of whom I'm **very** proud.

## Writing and Talks

I've written two books for O'Reilly ([Programming Jabber](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596002022.do) and [Google Pocket Guide](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Google_Pocket_Guide.html?id=cT9BrWQxTMcC&redir_esc=y)). I also conceived, edited and co-wrote a book on UI5 ([30 Days of UI5](https://www.amazon.co.uk/30-Days-UI5-Celebrating-milestone-ebook/dp/B017MOJEWG)) and am a co-author of the SAP Press book [Practical Workflow for SAP (3rd Ed.)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Workflow-Revised-Rickayzen-Hardcover/dp/B011DCBNZO).

My latest book, also for SAP Press, is [SAP Fiori and SAPUI5: Debugging the User Interface](https://www.sap-press.com/sap-fiori-and-sapui5-debugging-the-user-interface_4305/).

I've contributed articles to sites as diverse as O'Reilly's [OpenP2P](http://web.archive.org/web/20050206042302/http://www.openp2p.com/), the [SAP Community Network](http://scn.sap.com/people/dj.adams.sap/content), [Bluefin Solutions](http://web.archive.org/web/20180903093843/https://www.bluefinsolutions.com/insights/dj-adams) as well as writing posts on [my own blog here](/blog) where I've been blogging since 2002, as well as on the [SAP Community](//community.sap.com) where I've been writing (as [dj.adams.sap](//people.sap.com/dj.adams.sap) and previously as [dj.adams](//people.sap.com/dj.adams)) since its inception in 2003.

I've spoken at conferences such as [OSCON](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/oscon.html), JabberConf, [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org), [SAP Inside Track](http://scn.sap.com/community/events/inside-track), [SAP TechEd](http://www.sapteched.com), SAP d-kom, the [SAP UK & Ireland User Group Conference](http://www.sapusers.org/), the [SAP Architect & Developer Summit](/blog/posts/2014/11/28/the-inaugural-sap-architect-and-developer-summit/), [Manchester Digital Laboratory (MadLab)](http://madlab.org.uk), [Manchester Lambda Lounge](http://lambdalounge.org.uk), [UI5con](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTgtS6Cd98Y) and [TEDx](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gvOCaExeK0).

I run a live stream show called [Hands-on SAP Dev](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RpkC85SLQABOpzhd7WI-hMpy99PxUo0) and cover various technical topics in the SAP developer space. The main philosophy that guides each episode's content is "friendly chat and curiosity driven learning-by-doing".

## Bio and photos

Here's a short bio (and there's a slightly longer alternative on the [Developer Advocates](https://developers.sap.com/developer-advocates.html) page):

> Developer Advocate at SAP. O'Reilly and SAP Press author. SAP community pioneer and original SAP Community co-creator. Learner. Coffee drinker. Runner. "Bulldog of logic". Opinions my own, and there are many of them.

There are a couple of photos ([with jacket](../images/DJA-with-jacket.jpg) and [without jacket](../images/DJA-without-jacket.jpg)) available too, if you're looking for something more formal than my normal <a href="#main">floating head</a>.
