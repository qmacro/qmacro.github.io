title: Mr 80-Percent

Nick Denton wrote an [interesting article](http://www.nickdenton.org/docs/80_percent_company.mht) last month on how many hours people can, do, and should work in a week. It’s clear that he favours ‘80%ers’ over ‘120%ers’. I do too; having been in the fortunate position to do so, I made the move from a 5-day week to a 4-day week a couple of years ago. I’m not saying I don’t spend time at the keyboard during the 5th day, but it works wonders for one’s overall karma. Here’s to living life.
