 Hurrah! [Piers](http://www.piersharding.com/) and I are giving a talk at [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/), where the theme this year is “Embracing and Extending Proprietary Software”. Our talk is entitled “[Integrating SAP R/3 and Open Source Software](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/3759)“.

I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.
