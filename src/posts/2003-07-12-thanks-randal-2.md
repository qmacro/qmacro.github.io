I’m sitting here in a wonderful arcade of 80s arcade games, listening to [Rush](http://www.rushstuff.com/), arguably the best rock band ever, drinking beer, and enjoying WiFi, all courtesy of [Stonehenge](http://www.stonehenge.com/), and in particular [Randal Schwartz](http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/), the maverick entrepreneur who happens to be a great teacher of [Perl](http://www.perl.com/).

Stonehenge is hosting a post-[OSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/) [free beer and games](http://oscon.kwiki.org/index.cgi?FreeBeerAndGames) afternoon/evening event here in Portland; the place is packed and everywhere I hear the sounds “oooh, I remember this” or “aah, I used to be good at this game” from people rediscovering Galaga, Donkey Kong, Centipede and many other classic computer games from the 1980s.

I discovered Perl, and subsequently the power of Open Source, through Randal. Way back when, I discovered Randal’s [magazine columns on Perl](http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/columns.html). I regularly printed a column out, and took it to lunch with me to study. Getting back to the office, I used to enthuse about what I’d just learnt about “this new language” to my work colleagues (including [Piers](http://www.piersharding.com/)). I got to know Perl well, and haven’t looked back.

Thanks, Randal.
