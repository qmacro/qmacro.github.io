Inspired by a post “[Letter Sweep](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/03/03/ABC)” by [Tim Bray](http://twitter.com/timbray), here’s my browser A-Z, a list of the URLs that appear when the browser tries to guess, on a single letter press, where I want to go, based on past locations.

A: [appengine.google.com](http://appengine.google.com) – unsurprising, as I’m a big fan of Google’s App Engine.

B: [bbc.co.uk](http://bbc.co.uk) – where I go to get the news, although mostly I listen to [Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/) via my [Squeezebox Radio](http://www.logitech.com/speakers-audio/wireless-music-systems/devices/5847).

C: [coastandcountryholidays.co.uk](http://Coastandcountryholidays.co.uk) – Michelle and I are taking a holiday in Norfolk later this month.

D: [docs.google.com](http://Docs.google.com) – I’m a big Google Docs user.

E: [enterprisegeeks.com](http://Enterprisegeeks.com) – where I go for some excellent ERP / SAP banter.

F: [flickr.com](http://flickr.com) – I’ve been on Flickr for as long as I can remember.

G: [google.co.uk](http://Google.co.uk) – well, duh!

H: [http://www.google.co.uk](http://www.google.co.uk) – interesting! Isn’t using the scheme in the URL cheating?

I: [imdb.com](imdb.com) – we’re [Lovefilm](http://www.lovefilm.com) members, but I still use IMDB for film geekery.

J: [jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com](http://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com) – [JSON](http://www.json.org) is my poison, and this excellent site is the sweetener.

K: [www.amazon.co.uk/gp/digital/fiona/manage/ref=docs_dim_box](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/digital/fiona/manage/ref=docs_dim_box) – where I manage my Kindle. I think this is linked to K as I have a bookmark titled “K” pointing here.

L: [linkedin.com](http://linkedin.com) – essential!

M: [m.untappd.com](http://m.untappd.com) – even more essential! Also, perhaps more alarming, [Untappd](http://untappd.com) is the only site that appears more than once, apart from Google’s home page.

N: [natwest.com](http://natwest.com) – where I do some of my banking. National Westminster Bank.

O: [omniversity.madlab.org.uk](http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk) – The Manchester Digital Laboratory’s Omniversity. Excellent!

P: [pipetree.com](http://pipetree.com) – my main domain.

Q: [qmacro.appspot.com](http://qmacro.appspot.com) – not been here for a while, this was a general play area on App Engine.

R: [router](http://router/) – my Vigor router, to do the occasional port management.

S: [slashdot.org](http://slashdot.org/) – old but still ‘lesenswert’.

T: [twitter.com](http://twitter.com) – I’m a fan of [Seesmic’s web client](http://seesmic.com/w/), but still use the mothership app for lookups and the like.

U: [untappd.com/user/qmacro](http://untappd.com/user/qmacro) – ahem. Beer ahoy!

V: [vmlu02:8080](http://vmlu02:8080) – one of my servers; a virtual machine running on a micro-desktop on the shelves behind me. This is a port where I have an App Engine dev server listening.

W: [www.google.co.uk](http://www.google.co.uk) – three out of three!

X: nothing!

Y: [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) – I thought I was happy when the interweb was just text. But I was wrong.

Z: [zino:9000](http://zino:9000) – zino is the micro-desktop that hosts vmlu02. Listening on port 9000 is my [Squeezebox server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezebox_Server).
