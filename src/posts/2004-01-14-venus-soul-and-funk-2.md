title: Venus Soul and Fun(k)
---


I went out with my skiing friends last night, to work out who’s driving with whom on the way to Ischgl (“… du mein Traum!”) at the end of the month. We ended up at Kurios, a live music bar in Krefeld, where Venus was playing a set. We had a fun time, some great tracks too, from Chic, early Police, James Brown (ok, I’m older than I look, alright? :-) and so on. Played really well by the band.

Nice one, Venus!
