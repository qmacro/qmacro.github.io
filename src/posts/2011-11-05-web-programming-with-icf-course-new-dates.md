I’m pleased to announce that my 2-day [Omniversity](http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk) course [Web Programming with SAP’s Internet Communication Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1lX_X95LIaNBxlOsXxO_DFxYZfz4AxGyennxMNKIaaJE&pli=1) is coming up again a couple of times in the first half of next year.

SAP’s Internet Communication Framework (ICF) is the platform that underpins the majority of SAP’s offerings in this space, even SAP NetWeaver Gateway. This 2-day course will help you gain a detailed understanding of the framework, harness its power, and unleash your own resource orientated web service masterpieces!

Dates in March and May are available; follow the links to find out more and to book a place:

[Sat 03 – Sun 04 March 2012](http://s.madlab.org.uk/sap2)

[Wed 09 – Thu 10 May 2012](http://s.madlab.org.uk/sap3)

**Alternative Dispatcher Layer**

[One of the topics covered in Day 2](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1lX_X95LIaNBxlOsXxO_DFxYZfz4AxGyennxMNKIaaJE&pli=1#h.bz5oteq9itkk) on this course is the Alternative Dispatcher Layer (ADL), a lightweight alternative approach to building web applications, an approach informed and influenced by other libraries and frameworks such as the Python [webapp framework](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/) in Google App Engine. Read more about the origins of ADL in this SAP Developer Network post: [A new REST handler / dispatcher for the ICF](http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/weblogs?blog=/pub/wlg/15899).

Looking forward to seeing you on the course!
