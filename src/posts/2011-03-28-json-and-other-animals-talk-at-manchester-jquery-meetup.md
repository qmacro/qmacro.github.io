The [Manchester Digital Laboratory](http://madlab.org.uk/) ([MadLab](http://twitter.com/madlabuk) for short) is the arts-craft-tech gravity centre of Manchester, and our gracious hosts for the [Manchester Google Technology User Group](http://www.gtugs.org/chapter.jsp?id=1023). Recently a new group sprung up there – the [jQuery Manchester Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/jQuery-Manchester/), run by [Jon Vines](http://twitter.com/webvines). I gave a talk there earlier this month, on JSON, JSONP and AJAX. Here are the slides, and I’ve also created a [talk page](http://qmacro-demos.appspot.com/demos/manjquery-20110308/index.html) for this, with links to these slides and the code examples.
