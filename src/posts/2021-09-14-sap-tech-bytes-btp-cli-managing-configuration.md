*Understand and manage the btp CLI client configuration.*

ðŸš¨ Update: See [SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI - new home for
configuration](/blog/posts/2022/02/17/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-new-home-for-configuration/)
for new information.

This is a follow-on post from the previous one: [SAP Tech Bytes: btp
CLI - logging
in](/blog/posts/2021/09/07/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-logging-in/)
and starts where we left off there, with you logged in.

When you connect and authenticate, the connection and login details are
stored locally, as we noted from staring at the output from our initial
invocation of `btp`.

```text
Configuration:                     /home/user/.cache/.btp/config.json
```

This is the default location that `btp` uses.

## App Studio lifecycle

This post and the posts in the rest of this SAP Tech Bytes mini-series
are based on running the btp CLI in the SAP Business Application Studio
(App Studio). Certain directories in your App Studio dev space's work
area are cleaned up when a dev space is stopped and restarted.

One of those directories is the `/home/user/.cache/` directory.

If we look at this in detail (with `ls -la | grep .cache`), it's fairly
clear that it's ephemeral - here it's a symbolic link to a directory
in `/tmp/`:

```text
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    20 Sep  7 09:01 .cache -> /tmp/usertemp/.cache
```

In general, in most Unix-like environments, nothing in `/tmp/` is
guaranteed to be there after a restart. Given that this is where `btp`
stores configuration, what happens when our App Studio dev space is
stopped and then restarted? Well, let's find out.

First, let's make sure that we *are* still logged in, by invoking `btp`
with no further parameters. If we're logged in, we should see something
like this (i.e. `btp` shows us the details of our connection and
identity):

```text
SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.8.0)

Usage: btp [OPTIONS] ACTION [GROUP/OBJECT] [PARAMS]

CLI server URL:                    https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com (server v2.8.0)
User:                              P0003480944 (sapdeveloper@example.com)
Configuration:                     /home/user/.cache/.btp/config.json

Current target:
  Global account (subdomain: 82715b8dtrial-ga)
  â””â”€ Subaccount (ID: b8a33bf9-b155-4736-aadf-582dae8fd65a)

Tips:
  For information about the targeting mechanism, use 'btp --help target'.
  To display general help, use 'btp --help'.

OK
```

Next, go back to the App Studio "Dev Space Manager", and stop the dev
space you created for this btp CLI adventure (in [SAP Tech Bytes: btp
CLI -
installation](/blog/posts/2021/09/01/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-installation/)).
Once it's stopped, restart it and re-enter it.

## Starting over

Now, in a new terminal, first have a look in the `.cache/` directory (we
can refer to this relative name as we'll be in our home directory
`/home/user/` by default in a newly created terminal anyway):

```shell
ls --all --dereference --recursive .cache/
```

You won't see the `.btp/` directory or anything in it, because it's
not there any more (any content that is there will have been recreated
when the dev space was restarted).

Try `btp` again. This is the result:

```text
Welcome to the SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.8.0)

Usage: btp [OPTIONS] ACTION [GROUP/OBJECT] [PARAMS]

CLI server URL:                    not set
User:                              not set
Configuration:                     /home/user/.cache/.btp/config.json

You are currently not logged in.

Tips:
  To log in to a global account of SAP BTP, use 'btp login'. For help on login, use 'btp --help login'.
  To display general help, use 'btp --help'.

OK
```


Uh-oh! But not surprising, given that the configuration is gone.
Actually, there *is* some configuration now there, as `btp` will create
a `config.json` file on invocation. Use the `ls` command again to see,
and you should see (amongst the other content that was there) this:

```text
.cache:
.  ..  .btp

.cache/.btp:
.  ..  config.json
```

What's in `config.json`? Basically, this:

```json
{
  "ServerURL": "",
  "SubDomain": "",
  "UserName": "",
  "RefreshToken": "",
  "Directory": "",
  "Subaccount": "",
  "Version": "2.8.0",
  "Authentication": {
    "User": "",
    "Mail": ""
  },
  "TrustedURLs": null,
  "Autocomplete": null
}
```

(although it is flat, unformatted - it wasn't prettified like that).

So now we understand why `btp` shows nothing, and that we're not logged
in any more.

## Managing our configuration

We need to have the configuration stored in a different place, and used
from there, so it persists. Personally, I'm a fan of the [X Desktop
Group (XDG) Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec.latest.html),
which defines environment variables that apps can heed.
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is one of those, and "*defines the base directory
relative to which user-specific configuration files should be
stored.*". Moreover, it goes on to say: "*If \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME is
either not set or empty, a default equal to \$HOME/.config should be
used.*". That works as a nice default for me.

The btp CLI allows you to [specify the location of the configuration
file](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/e57288d7f2aa4e59a8f70b08b82a933d.html)
either using the `--config` option, which you'll need to specify on
each invocation of `btp`, or using the environment variable
`SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG`.

Let's tell the btp CLI that we want our configuration in this location
(relative to our home directory):

```text
.config/btp/config.json
```

Environment variables are best set when a shell session starts, so
let's add the appropriate assignment to `SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG` in the
same file as we added the `bin/` directory to our path in the [previous
post](/blog/posts/2021/09/01/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-installation/).
This is the `.bashrc` file in our home directory.

You can edit this file using App Studio of course. First, open your home
directory as a folder in the explorer, using the "Open Folder" button
like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/2021-09-01-btp-cli/draftposts/images/open-home-in-explorer.png)

Then find and open the `.bashrc` file from the Explorer, and at the
bottom, add content so it looks like this:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG=$HOME/.config/btp/config.json
```

Close any existing terminal session and start a new one (Terminal -\>
New Terminal); this will cause the `.bashrc` file to be processed, and
you can then check that the `SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG` environment variable is
indeed now set:

```shell
echo $SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG
```

It should show you this:

```text
/home/user/.config/btp/config.json
```

Now it's time to log back in with the btp CLI. Follow the same login
procedure as described in the previous post [SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI -
logging
in](/blog/posts/2021/09/07/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-logging-in/).
Use the `btp target` command to specify your trial subaccount too.

Invoking `btp` on its own now should show familiar information:

```text
SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.8.0)

Usage: btp [OPTIONS] ACTION [GROUP/OBJECT] [PARAMS]

CLI server URL:                    https://cpcli.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com (server v2.8.0)
User:                              P0003480944 (sapdeveloper@example.com)
Configuration:                     /home/user/.config/btp/config.json

Current target:
  Global account (subdomain: 82715b8dtrial-ga)
  â””â”€ Subaccount (ID: b8a33bf9-b155-4736-aadf-582dae8fd65a)

Tips:
  For information about the targeting mechanism, use 'btp --help target'.
  To display general help, use 'btp --help'.

OK
```

But note the location of the configuration - it is honouring where we
told the btp CLI to keep it, via `SAPCP_CLIENTCONFIG`. Great!

## Final checks

Go through the process of restarting your dev space once more. When
starting a new terminal after that, and invoking `btp`, you should see
that your configuration has survived, and you're still logged in.
Great!

In the next post, we look at adding a whole ton of comfort to invoking
commands with the btp CLI: [SAP Tech Bytes: btp CLI --
autocompletion](/blog/posts/2021/09/21/sap-tech-bytes:-btp-cli-autocompletion/).
