_This document is for me to use during, and to distribute after, a lecture at Manchester's Xaverian College, where I'm very honoured to be able to help introduce some core concepts in functional programming, in my role as STEM Ambassador._

_I'm writing it in draft mode in public, as a sort of experiment. [Feedback](mailto:qmacro@gmail.com?Subject=FOFP%20Feedback) gratefully accepted!_

**Part 1 - First-class functions, list processing and higher-order functions**

[Introduction](/2016/05/03/fofp-1-1-introduction)

[Trying things out](/2016/05/03/fofp-1-2-trying-things-out)

[Some basic list processing](/2016/05/03/fofp-1-3-some-basic-list-processing)

[A different approach with map](/2016/05/03/fofp-1-4-a-different-approach-with-map/)

[Creating functions](/2016/05/03/fofp-1-5-creating-functions)

**Part 2 - More higher order functions**

[A look at filter](/2016/05/04/fofp-2-1-a-look-at-filter)

Transforming with fold (aka reduce)

**Part 3 - Different syntaxes and languages**

JavaScript and ES6

Fat arrows and more concise function definitions

Our examples in Clojure

**Part 4 - Classic list processing**

(To cover lists, head+tail / first+rest and recursion)
