title: Bot window as command line of the future
---


I visited [Matt’s blog](http://interconnected.org/home/) today after finding his Google script that I’ve adopted, and followed an interesting link to an article, [“Search the web via IM”](http://www.instantmessagingplanet.com/public/article/0,,10817_1012411,00.html), in which Matt is interviewed regarding [Googlematic](http://interconnected.org/googlematic/). It’s interesting that the ideas expressed at the start of the article:

> * Do you use your IM client so much that you feel like you live in it? Would you like to use it for tasks other than one-to-one communication — say, for looking up Web pages? *

are in line with what I wrote about in an article about Jabber and bots called [“Is Jabber’s Chatbot the Command Line of the Future?”](http://web.archive.org/web/20040203121753/http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/01/11/jabber_bots.html).

I do like the idea of permanent windows opened and connected to bots providing services.
