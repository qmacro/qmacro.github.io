In May I was approached by a chap at SAP in Walldorf who wanted to ask me some questions on blogging (I [have a blog](http://scn.sap.com/people/dj.adams/content) over on the [SAP Developer Network](http://www.sdn.sap.com)) for an article he was writing for an SAP-internal magazine.

One of the questions was “**Why do you write two blogs?**“. I wrote a longish reply, and thought it was worth putting up here (mostly because he didn’t use any of it ;-)

My answer:

*  
 Well, there are many reasons. Here are the main ones: *

(a) History

I was writing on my blog before SDN came along. SDN came along, and I  
 was invited to write some posts there. I did. I continue to post on my  
 blog while contributing to the collective SDN one too.

(b) Freedom

The web is a great leveller. There’s no ‘us and them’ anymore. And  
 with weblogs crystallising the essence of publishing at the individual  
 level, everyone benefits. Get a weblog, express your voice. It’s  
 your individual press. I’m a member of SDN, but like everyone else,  
 still a guest there. SDN is run by, hosted by, and funded by SAP. So  
 naturally I feel restricted in what I can, or should, say. There have  
 been occasions when what people have written on SDN has ruffled a few  
 feathers. Sometimes because what they wrote is ridiculous and negative,  
 and others because what they wrote flies in the face of where SAP is  
 going, in a technology context (I experienced the latter first hand).

Writing in my own blog means that I know that I’m not going to be  
 censored, or have my posts pulled. This isn’t by any means a criticism  
 of SAP or SDN. It’s just the way it is.

(c) Technology

When SDN first came along, it wasn’t properly on the web. It was an  
 island, blocked off by the requirement to register and log on with a  
 userid and password. Many people (including me) hassled the SDN team  
 into removing the registration and authentication restriction (at least  
 for people who just wanted to _read_ stuff). And they did. Kudos to  
 those who made the wheels turn (and they know who they are).

Now it’s time, in my opinion, for SDN to embrace community technologies  
 even more, and use the power of RSS (and / or Atom) to aggregate weblog  
 posts into one big ‘Planet SAP’. Syndicate blogs from around the  
 web-o-sphere into a single place. Many communities do this to great  
 effect. If SDN doesn’t do it, I’m sure someone else will come along  
 and do it eventually. Embrace, don’t resist :-)

So if there was a ‘Planet SAP’ weblog aggregation mechanism, I’d only  
 have to write on one blog, my own, and the SAP stuff would appear in SDN.

Actually, I write on three blogs. The third is a shared “Mr Angry” type  
 weblog where I rant. And rant. And rant.

As I was writing the bit about aggregation, I thought “Why don’t I do that?”. So I did. Using the excellent [Planet Planet](http://www.planetplanet.org) aggregation software, I put together [Planet SAP](http://www.pipetree.com/planetsap).

It’s in the early stages, gathering posts from only a small number of feeds. If you have SAP related things to say, and a feed for it, give me a shout, and I can add it. It’s just an experiment right now … let’s see how it goes.
