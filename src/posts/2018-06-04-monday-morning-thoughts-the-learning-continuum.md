*In this post I contemplate the idea of the learning continuum, and
think about the fact that we're all learning together, which is a good
thing.*

On a run last week I listened to an episode of Scott Hanselman's
"Hanselminutes": [Functional Programming, F#, and Cloud Containers
with Lena
Hall](https://www.hanselminutes.com/613/functional-programming-f-and-cloud-containers-with-lena-hall).
There was so much content in there that interests me, from functional
programming with F# itself, to its application to serverless and the
Kubernetes context. The wonderful thing is that pretty much all that is
relevant to some degree or other in our enterprise software future.

But the one thing that struck me as I followed the trails through
[Clayton Vale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Vale) on my way in
to Manchester was that there's something that's unsaid but clearly
present in the developer communities at large and it was clear during
the interview between Scott and Lena. That something is what I'm going
to call a "learning continuum", and its relevance is even stronger
this week as we prepare ourselves for one of the two major learning
events of the year in the SAP calendar - SAPPHIRENOW (the other of
course being SAP TechEd).

to read next*

## The learning continuum

The pace of change in computing is ever increasing. One consequence of
this is, as I've said often enough, that to remain relevant as a
developer, a key skill you need is the ability to learn, and you need to
put that skill into practice often.

Listening to uxkjaer talk to craig.cmehil in the most
recent episode of [SAP Coffee Corner
Radio](https://creators.spotify.com/pod/profile/sap-community-podcast/) I heard some definitions of
community. I'd suggest that there's an extra definition that's
relevant here, adding a layer of meaning, and that is the fact that
we're all learning. At different paces, certainly in different subject
areas, and to different degrees and depths, but we're all learning, and
learning together.

That's why the concepts of blog posts and Q&A fit so well into the
mechanics of the online presence of a community - because they're
obvious outlets for learning and sharing. There's the idea, attributed
to Albert Einstein, and also built into a process associated with
Richard Feynman, that the best way to learn about something is to try to
explain it, or teach it, to others. For me, at least, writing posts
about certain technical subjects certainly helps me better understand
those subjects.

The concept of shared learning has existed since the dawn of [the first
SAP
communities](/blog/posts/2005/07/04/the-sap-developer-community-10-years-ago/)
in the form of the two mailing lists that Bryan Thorp and I ran back in
the mid 1990's. People learning, and learning openly, helping each
other out on their individual but ultimately shared journeys.

Those shared journeys represent different pathways through the learning
continuum. The learning continuum is ever present, and even more
relevant today as we embark on perhaps one of the biggest sea changes in
the SAP technical landscape.

## Integrity through transparency

One thing that resounded during the Hanselminutes episode was the
unspoken idea that both Scott and Lena were learning, and in no way did
they think that the learning journey was something to hide or be ashamed
of. Scott was learning from Lena, and Lena herself, the expert being
interviewed, talked about her learning journey too. Lena described how
some aspects of her journey into functional programming "broke her
mind", and Scott recounted a similar angle relating to the Dvorak
keyboard. The point is that neither of them felt there was anything
wrong with starting out as a beginner in a subject, and that is a
wonderful thing.

This is something that is perhaps obvious to some, but not so obvious to
others. When a new subject comes along, there are very few experts -
we're almost all beginners. That's just the natural order of things,
and is a constant in the learning continuum.

## The continuum expansion

Take, for example, the recent blog post by yuval.anafi: "[Develop SAP
Cloud Platform Business Applications with SAP Web
IDE](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/06/03/develop-sap-cloud-platform-business-applications-with-sap-web-ide/)".
It was only last week when I came across the [Getting Started
tutorial](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/5ec8c983a0bf43b4a13186fcf59015fc.html),
to which the post refers, and which is part of a new documentation set
on the [SAP Cloud Platform application programming
model](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html).
What struck me the most was not the amazing work that the SAP Web IDE
team has put into the heavy-lifting magic relating to build & deploy
services on the SAP Cloud Platform (although that deserves some
contemplation and is definitely worthy of another post sometime), but
the fact that the subject of the post, and the tutorial, helps a great
deal to crystallise the part of the continuum that lies just in front of
us.

In a previous post in this [Monday morning
thoughts](/tags/mondaymorningthoughts/) series (on
[milestones](/blog/posts/2018/05/21/monday-morning-thoughts:-milestones/))
I suggested that Core Data Services (CDS) was worthy of being considered
a major milestone. Mixing stone metaphors slightly, I would suggest that
it is also a cornerstone in what we build, and how we build, in the next
generation of SAP solutions. And the ideas & concrete artifacts that
explode outwards from the CDS core itself - annotations for the
frontend, and databases and services for the backend - are suddenly
squarely present in the learning continuum for us.

## Learn together, grow together

In our [Manchester chapter of the Mikkeller Running
Club](https://web.archive.org/web/20160309010719/http://mikkellerrunningclub.dk/chapters/manchester/) we have an
unofficial tagline which is "run together, drink
together". That suits us well and fits what we're about (a running club that's
based in a brewery, with members who all enjoy good beer). I think
there's a similar idea that we can use for our collective journey along
the next stage of the learning continuum, and that is "learn together,
grow together".

With many of the subjects at hand, there are hardly any of us that are
experts. But that shouldn't stop us sharing our journeys of discovery,
the highs of success (I got it to work!), the lows of frustration (why
doesn't this do what I want?) resulting in a rich collective layering
of knowledge and experience that in turn will attract and help others.

I for one have gone through that tutorial three or four times, and
expect to continue that repetition, because the seam I'm mining is so
rich, and I'm such a beginner. I know I'm about to embark on the next
stage of my self-education, and am looking forward to it very much.

What areas of the learning continuum are you contemplating tackling, and
what are you hoping to level up on?

humid dawn run around the streets of Vineland in Orlando, Florida, and
some pretty average tasting coffee from the hotel breakfast area.
