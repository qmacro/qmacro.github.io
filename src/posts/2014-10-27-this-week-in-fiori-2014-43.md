title: This Week in Fiori (2014-43)
---

Hello everybody, Brenton here in for DJ this week. For those of you who don’t know me, I work in the Fiori and User experience space with DJ and I am a fellow SAPUI5/OpenUI5 advocate for a long time now. I focus more on the mobility side of things more than anything else but for me it’s all about bringing amazing solutions to end users and having a bit of fun while doing it :-)

So this week of course was the beginning of what I call TechEd season or now I suppose we have to call it d-code season. Last week saw SAP TechEd and d-code take place in the wonderful Venetian resort in Las Vegas. Now that I am starting to get over my jet lag, DJ asked me to jot down a few of the highlights for this edition of “This Week in Fiori”. 

**[SAP Executive Keynote from SAP TechEd & D-code](http://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/13492) by Steve Lucas** 

The first mention has to go, of course, to the keynote with Steve Lucas. With a relaxed and developer focused atmosphere it was an incredibly enjoyable 75 minutes covering some of the amazing things that people are doing with SAP software. The reason it gets a special mention here is because it was (for me anyway) the first time I saw SAP Fiori on a watch. Steve introduces a real-time Fiori application on the HANA cloud platform which was integrated with and primarily used on Samsung’s latest smart watches. The demo is at about 59+ minutes for anybody interested. In fact, the entire keynote is well worth the time as it really brought to life some of SAP’s new technologies. 

**[SAP Fiori Launchpad Overview](http://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/13578) by Aviad Rivlin**

Aviad does it again with this excellent overview of the SAP Fiori Launchpad in this voice-over session. Talking us through the Launchpad itself, it’s capabilities as well as an overview of how the launchpad could work in a Hybrid scenario where some functionality is based on-premise and some based in the cloud. Well worth a watch for anybody interested or working with the Launchpad. 

**[Unified Inbox with SAP Fiori](http://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/13558) by Ramana Mohanbabu**

This was quite an interesting session I enjoyed covering the connection of the SAP Fiori Unified inbox to multiple systems to give an end user access to all of their SBWP items in a much more usable way. 

**[Swell Analytics](http://events.sap.com/teched/en/session/13682) by Clint Vosloo and Chris Rae**

Although competing directly with myself and John Appleby during this years DemoJam I am always more than happy to give credit where it is most definitely due and these guys deserve it! They created an amazing application using OpenUI5 to identify, predict and rate the quality of swells for surfers (yes I said surfers!). Well worth a watch and shows off the awesome stuff you can build with OpenUI5. These are just 4 of the very many Fiori and OpenUI5 related sessions from Las Vegas that caught my eye. If I was to mention all of the sessions, you would get bored far quicker than I can type so I won’t even try. But please do check out the rest of the sessions covering all SAP’s new offerings from the HANA Cloud Platform (HCP), SAP Mobile Secure right through to the easy way developers can try all this out for themselves at [hcp.sap.com](http://hcp.sap.com/). 

So all that is left for me to do is thank DJ for allowing me to post on some of my experiences from Las Vegas. TWIF is an excellent series and one I love reading each week! Comments most welcome as always! 

Brenton.
