*Composing good questions is important and will help your fellow
community members answer them more easily. This post suggests some key
aspects of a good question, and also gives some tips on how to
respond.*

The concept of Q&A in online communities goes back as far as I can
remember, way before the days of the Web, even before the days of the
Internet. And what's held true all this time is that the availability,
quality and usefulness of the answers relates directly to the quality of
the questions. Ask a question well, and you're more likely to get
engagement from fellow community members and they're more likely to try
to, and be able to, help you.

Almost 6 years ago I wrote a post "[HelpÂ  us to help you - Share Your
Code](/blog/posts/2014/01/09/help-us-to-help-you-share-your-code/)"
which is still relevant today, but I thought this new post might be more
appropriate with new information that will hopefully help us all build a
corpus of Q&A content that is easy to add to and useful to refer to.
Then and now I'm primarily referring to questions related to
development topics, but the sentiments are relevant beyond that too.

## Asking questions

Here's what a good question looks like:

-   It describes the context clearly, both via an initial sentence or
    two and via appropriate tags
-   Relevant code is shown in-line in the question, appropriately
    formatted, so that the reader can see the code directly in the same
    flow as trying to understand what is being asked (all unnecessary
    code and comments have been removed to make the code shown as small
    as possible)
-   The question has a link to a complete reproducible minimal scenario
    that has been put together specifically to demonstrate the problem,
    and this scenario is easily cloneable and runnable by the reader
    (see the "[Help us to help you - Share Your
    Code](/blog/posts/2014/01/09/help-us-to-help-you-share-your-code/)"
    post for more information on using e.g. JSBin, GitHub / Gists or
    other mechanisms\*)
-   If a diagram or screenshot would help with explaining the scenario,
    that would be provided too, also in-line
-   You've described what you've tried so far, and what the results of
    those efforts have been
-   Any additional detail you've been subsequently asked to provide has
    been edited into the original question

(\*In the case of CAP related questions, you can consider using the
issues section of the CAP Community GitHub repo at
[bit.ly/cap-com](https://bit.ly/cap-com))

While I've described some "Do"s, I'll list some "Don't"s which
should be obvious but are probably worth listing enumerating here:

-   Don't provide code that is not properly formatted - it just makes
    it hard for the reader to comprehend; use the code formatting
    features appropriately
-   Don't provide code as attachments to the question - that's even
    worse than providing unformatted code as it places the onus on the
    reader to take pains to download the attachments, load them into an
    editor, work out what's what, and then continue reading
-   Don't add further information anywhere else (except for the
    cloneable and runnable scenario) - if you need to add more
    information, do it in the original question by editing it
-   Unless you are directly answering your own question, don't use any
    of the "Answer" sections - if you are responding to a comment,
    either do it with a further comment or (if appropriate) update your
    question content

## Responding to questions

There's an art to responding to questions too, here are some thoughts
on that (note that I wrote "responding to questions", as there's more
to it than just "answering"):

-   If you need the person asking the question (often referred to as the
    "Original Poster" or "OP") to clarify something or otherwise
    improve or provide more detail to the question, use a Comment to ask
    them to do so (i.e. don't use an Answer)
-   In general, use Comments to correspond with the OP and other
    participants, \*unless\* you're answering the question (in which
    case of course use an Answer)
-   If you need to show code in your answer, follow the same guidelines
    as for asking questions - make sure it's formatted appropriately,
    and either in-line in the answer (that's the ideal scenario, not
    the whole solution, just the relevant parts) or linked to elsewhere

## Upvoting and downvoting

There's a reason we have upvoting and downvoting buttons. If you think
a question or answer is a good one, then upvote it with the up-arrow. It
will help the author of the upvoted item understand that they provided
something of value. If you feel you should downvote a question or an
answer, do so but always provide a reason, as a comment, as to why you
downvoted it.

If you're the OP and someone's provided an answer to your question
that's appropriate, ensure you mark it as such.

## Summary

Hopefully the advice in this post is useful. Some of it is practical,
some of it is related to etiquette. I'll leave it up to you to work out
which bits are what. It's not polite to ask a question "lazily", by
not stating the problem clearly, not showing what efforts you've made
to solve it, and by not making it as easy as possible for your fellow
community members to help out.

Help us to help you, and let's do our best to build a valuable database
of knowledge through the next decade.

question](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/)"
(thanks frehu for the pointer).

## Examples

As and when I come across what I think are nice examples of good
questions, I'll post links to them here.

-   [CAP: Custom logic not receiving query
    parameters](https://answers.sap.com/questions/12951244/cap-custom-logic-not-receiving-query-parameters.html)
