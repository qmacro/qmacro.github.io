*In this post, I think about the different ways I learn, and wonder how
that translates to how we learn in the SAP developer ecosphere.*

This will be a shorter post than usual\*, as I've just arrived at the
(second worst) airport (in the world) on my way to the third and final
instance of this year's SAP TechEd event, in Bangalore. As I sit here
with some coffee, I've been thinking about my experiences at the recent
[Developer Relations
Conference](https://london-2018.devrel.net) (DevRelCon) in London
earlier this month.

\* some of you may be breathing a sigh of relief!

I've written about some of my experiences already at DevRelCon in a
previous [Monday morning
thoughts](/tags/mondaymorningthoughts/) post on
[longevity and loose
coupling](/blog/posts/2018/11/12/monday-morning-thoughts:-longevity-and-loose-coupling/),
where I thought about some of GitHub's features in relation to webhooks
and serverless computing in general. But this time I'd like to dwell a
short while on some other stuff that I learned during the conference.
The bottom line is that technology is changing all the time, and to
remain relevant, one needs to keep learning. That means that there's a
requirement for education. What sort of education is that, and what does
it look like [where the rubber meets the
road](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_rubber_meets_the_road)?

## A complete education experience

Conversations at the conference confirmed to me that rather than islands
of information, developers are looking for that "complete education
experience". What does that mean? Well, to me, and based on what I
heard from others, it's long term learning based on focused paths
through the myriad options and directions, with a personalised platform
that keeps track of where you are and what you've achieved. Moreover,
it includes a clear indication of learning goals, and definitions of
"what good looks like" with respect to mastery of a subject.

I'm mindful of our [tutorial
system](https://developers.sap.com/tutorial-navigator.html) within our
developer home space at <https://developers.sap.com>, and with the
recent revamp for the start of the SAP TechEd season, I do think we're
on the right path, especially having heard from others at the
conference, and what their and their companies' aspirations in this
respect were. If you've not tried the new tutorial experience, with
groups of tutorials around a certain topic, and missions that cluster
together tutorial groups, I'd definitely recommend you give it a try -
kick those rubber tyres.

But of course there's content beyond our tutorial navigator in the
wider SAP ecosphere world. There's the [SAP Help
Portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/), various YouTube channels, such as
the [SAP HANA Academy](https://www.youtube.com/user/saphanaacademy), and
who could omit the wonderful Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)
[openSAP](https://open.sap.com) with some excellent courses that run
over weeks.

And we can't forget the less structured but nevertheless essential
content here in the SAP Community, written by and for the community
members themselves (us, in other words).

## How do you learn best?

What I've been pondering, though, is - moving a layer above - how do
people really learn? What are the different media (mediums if we're
being post-Latin, but who wants to be post-Latin?) available, and what
are the pros and cons of each. More importantly, what works for us?
Conversations with work colleagues over the years has shown me that
we're all different, we all consume information our own way, at our own
pace, and different media resonates differently with each of us.

I've even been looking into the modern realms of [Twitch
TV](https://www.twitch.tv/) recently (based on some other conversations
at DevRelCon). It has certainly been eye opening - who knew there were
so many games out there and so many folks not only playing but
spectating? I found the [Science & Technology
channel](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology) in
which various folks teach, indirectly, I guess, by streaming their live
coding experiences. Fascinating, and I learned stuff almost by accident
while transfixed by the experience.

So, as I head to the gate to take my first flight of the day, I'd like
to leave the rest of this Monday morning thoughts post in your hands.
Let me know in the comments below how you learn. What's your preferred
medium, and why? What learning experiences have you had, what has worked
well, what hasn't worked so well? Are you a video watcher, or a reader?
For a new subject, do you reach for YouTube, the SAP Help Portal, blog
posts, Q&A or something else? As we move further and further into the
cloud and merge with the wider developer ecosphere, what experiences
have you had there that we could learn from?

I look forward to hearing from you in the comments.

And if you're at [SAP TechEd in
Bangalore](https://events.sap.com/teched-2018-india/en/home), come and
say hi at the Developer Garage, and tell me directly how you learn
best!

This post was brought to you by the hustle and bustle of an early Monday
morning in Manchester airport, by Pret-A-Manger's filter coffee (not
too bad actually), and by the prospect of the "travel-daze" that I'm
going to be experiencing for the next 16 hours or so.
