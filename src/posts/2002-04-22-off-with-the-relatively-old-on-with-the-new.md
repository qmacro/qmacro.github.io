The move from Peerkat to Blosxom coincided with open disk surgery on our colo box that hosts this website. I’ve got this weblog up and running but need to install Python so I can boot my Peerkat-based experiments previously at http://www.pipetree.com:8080.

I’m really taken with the simplicity of Blosxom. As the weblog entries are simply textfiles, I think I’m going to start using CVS to give me the ability to write offline too. I travel a lot, and my trust Sony Linux laptop goes everywhere with me.
