Next month, in Sydney, the inaugural [SAP Architect & Developer Summit](http://events.sap.com/au/sap-architect-and-developer-summit/en/home?bc=1%1%0) is taking place, on the 20th and 21st of November. This is quite an exciting direction for an SAP event; yes, we have [SAP TechEd && d-code](http://www.sapdcode.com/) (almost upon us) which caters for the developers and architects among us, but this short summit-style conference looks to be spot on in terms of content for the “non-suits”.

The agenda is packed with sessions I’m really looking forward to attending, and a huge list of amazing folks from the SAP world are there – many of them presenting. Check out the full agenda, available from [this page](http://events.sap.com/au/sap-architect-and-developer-summit/en/agendas3?bc=1%2%0) to see what I mean.

I’m rather honoured to have been invited, and have a couple of speaking slots. I’ve added my sessions to [the Lanyrd page for the conference](http://lanyrd.com/2014/sap-architect-and-developer-summit/), so the links below will take you to the slots there:

On day 1, I’m giving the Locknote Address, which is at the end of the day’s sessions and just before the cocktails, so I’d better keep it short and to the point! — [Fiori & UI5 Software Logistics, or: Are We In The Future Yet?](http://lanyrd.com/2014/sap-architect-and-developer-summit/sdfyrd/)

On day 2, I’m running a 2 hour hands-on workshop “[Learn to Drive Fiori Apps from Underneath and Level Up!](http://lanyrd.com/2014/sap-architect-and-developer-summit/sdfyrf/)“. This should be a lot of fun, and revolves around mastering the perfect storm of Chrome’s Developer Tools and the UI5 toolkit and support mechanisms.

As well as the summit’s website itself, you can read more about the event on Thomas Jung’s post on SCN: “[Coming Down Under – see you at SAP Architect and Developer Summit in Sydney](http://scn.sap.com/community/events/blog/2014/10/10/coming-down-under-see-you-at-sap-architect-and-developer-summit-in-sydney)“.

I’m really excited to be attending, not least because I’m finally going to meet some of my heroes from the Australia & NZ SAP developer world. Sydney here I come!
