On Monday 24 March 2014 we will have a public SAP Mentor Monday session on the subject of UI5.

UPDATE 25/03/2014: Links to the recording and items mentioned in this session are available.

For those of you who don't know, a public SAP Mentor Monday is an hour-long webinar format where everyone is invited and the subject is a specific topic. The subject of this public SAP Mentor Monday is UI5. That is to say, SAPUI5 and OpenUI5 - the licenced and open source versions both. UI5 is the toolkit that is powering the UI/UX revolution at SAP, and we have a special guest that will join us from the UI5 team in Walldorf - Andreas Kunz.

These are exciting times for SAP, and for me there's no place nearer the epicentre of the visible renewal than UI5.

Join the webinar to hear about and discuss UI5, with folk who share your interest. I'll be hosting it, and if you want to submit questions in advance, you can do so using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdQa6YFm2KcnplAEDnIlnkpTsgVQC4ku7YTBI8QdmrQ9HCNw/viewform).
