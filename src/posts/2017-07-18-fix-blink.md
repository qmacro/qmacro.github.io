If you want to get rid of the rather distracting blinking text ("Supported browser versions") in the timesheet system, use this bookmarklet. Assuming you're using the Chrome browser (if you care about standards, security and performance why would you not be?), do this:

__Step 1: Make sure your bookmark bar is visible__

See the help article [How to use the bookmarks bar](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95745?hl=en-GB) for more details on this.

__Step 2: Drag this link to the bookmark bar__

<a href="javascript:(function(){ blinkeffect = function() {};})();">Fix Timesheet Blink</a>

It's called a "bookmarklet" and is a bit of JavaScript code.

__Step 3: Click the bookmarklet when you're in the Timesheet__

Whenever you start up the timesheet system, click the bookmarklet once you're in ... and breath a sigh of relief.
