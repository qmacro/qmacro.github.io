I don’t think I mentioned it directly here (perhaps partly a cause *and* effect of the recent blogging hiatus) but the [Google Pocket Guide](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/googlepg "Google Pocket Guide") has recently been released. Hurrah! It’s a book I worked on with [Rael](http://www.raelity.org/ "Rael Dornfest") and [Tara](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/873 "Tara Calishain") (nice work, you two!). Talking to people at [O’Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/ "O'Reilly and Associates") last week at [OSCON](http://conferences.oreilly.com/os2003), it seems the guide is selling well. Hurrah again!

It was a very interesting time. Rather than mainly authoring, most of my work was editing, restructuring, and adding some new content. In the past, I have denied the existence of a somewhat strenuous attention to prose detail, but I guess I finally have to admit that it’s there. I really enjoyed the challenge, although it was hard work using a combination of [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/)‘s word processing program and MS-Word. Give me [DocBook](http://www.docbook.org/) and a [proper editor](http://www.vim.org/) any day (I wrote [Programming Jabber](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/jabber "Programming Jabber") this way).
