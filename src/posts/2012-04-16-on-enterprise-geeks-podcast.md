Last month at SAP DKOM, where I rediscovered [SAP’s Developer Connection](/2012/04/01/the-developer-connection-connect-like-never-before/), I bumped into an old friend, [Craig Cmehil](https://wiki.sdn.sap.com/wiki/display/profile/Craig+Cmehil). Craig is one part of the [Enterprise Geeks](http://enterprisegeeks.com/blog/about/), a loose collective of geeks and hackers whose friendships were formed in the SAP space. The Enterprise Geeks are famous for their podcasts, and I was very honoured to be a guest on that very show.

Here’s the post: “[DJ Adams and a trip down technology lane](http://enterprisegeeks.com/blog/2012/04/16/dj-adams-and-a-trip-down-technology-lane/)“. If you’re after the audio file directly, it’s [here](http://enterprisegeeks.com/blog/podcasts/eGeeks_DJAdams_March_2012.m4a).

I had a lot of fun. Thanks Craig!
