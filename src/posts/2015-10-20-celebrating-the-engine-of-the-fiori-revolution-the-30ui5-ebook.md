Last month saw the milestone release of 1.30 of SAP's UI5 toolkit, the engine that is powering the vast majority of the Fiori User Experience (UX) revolution. For SAP TechEd 2015 we're releasing a downloadable electronic version of the "30 Days of UI5" series of blog post written to celebrate that.

**UPDATED: 09 Nov 2015 - [Now available as a Kindle version on Amazon!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017MOJEWG)**

Last month, I wrote about our "30 Days of UI5" series of blog posts in [The advent of UI5 1.30 and what it means for us](/blog/posts/2015/09/09/the-advent-of-ui5-1.30-and-what-it-means-for-us/). It was a joint effort between a number of our developer community team members, and SAP colleagues too. It exists in its original form as [a series of 30 blog posts](/blog/posts/2015/07/04/welcome-to-30-days-of-ui5!/), but for SAP TechEd 2015 we're releasing the series as a complete electronic version, for your reading pleasure!

It seems fitting to release it right now. While I'm not at [SAP TechEd USA in Las Vegas](http://web.archive.org/web/20170915091005/http://events.sap.com/teched-2015-usa/en/home) (except in spirit, as I seem to have appeared\* in the hallways of the SAP TechEd convention centre, \*blush\*) I know that there will be plenty of transactional and application eye candy on screens all around the place.

And you can bet your bottom dollar that much of it will be powered by the engine of that Fiori revolution - SAP's UI5 toolkit.

So to celebrate that, to thank the super teams of developers and designers at SAP who have nurtured UI5 from the ground up, and to share with you some hopefully interesting and intricate aspects of that toolkit, it seems appropriate to release the series as a downloadable whole. As a bonus, it has a great foreword from one of the core UI5 developers Andreas Kunz, with some great history of where UI5 came from. Worth the download alone!

First up, for SAP TechEd USA in Las Vegas this week, we have the PDF version. It's less than 100 pages, so go nuts, buy some ink, print it off, and enjoy a relaxing soak in the bath with it.

If you're more of a Kindle person, then we'll be releasing a version for you in time for [SAP TechEd EMEA](http://web.archive.org/web/20170915091005/http://events.sap.com/teched-2015-emea/en/home) in Barcelona in November, so watch this space! UPDATE: [Now available!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017MOJEWG)

So, without further ado, the PDF version of 30 Days of UI5 is available here: [30 Days of UI5 - PDF Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Assa05Fog5X1BjU1gtNnZtNDg/view?usp=share_link&resourcekey=0-Af3eCjLKdWq1hK-1j-t66w).
