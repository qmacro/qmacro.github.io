I’m sure you’re all aware of the recent #blogtheft issue – where some rogue has been lifting content lock stock and barrel from here and reproducing it – sans author name – on their website www.sap-abap4.com. [Stop Thief – It’s #blogtheft!](https://blogs.sap.com/2009/08/25/stop-thief-its-blogtheft/) and [Stolen Content](https://blogs.sap.com/2009/08/28/stolen-content/) have blogged about it here already.

In Craig’s Friday Morning Report yesterday, I suggested:

*13:32 qmacro: get SAP hosting to send alternative “STOLEN!” images to rogue referrer – Google “image theft apache” for examples*

and straight after the conference call finished, I thought I’d demo how that could be done. I implemented such a mechanism for images on an SDN blog post of mine, images that just happened to be hosted on my machine. I wrote about how that was done in a weblog post:

[Dealing with “#blogtheft” from SAP’s Developer Network](/blog/posts/2009/08/28/dealing-with-"blogtheft"-from-sap's-developer-network/)

This morning, @thorstenster alerted me to the fact that SAP have now implemented this for images hosted here on SDN:

Now that’s a **great** reaction! Kudos to the SAP Community Network hackers who look after the servers here. To implement something like that in such a short space of time and on the production servers … I take my hat off to you folks. Well done.
