Today I was privileged to host a [public SAP Mentor Monday on UI5, with Andreas Kunz as special guest](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2014/02/13/public-sap-mentor-monday-on-ui5-with-andreas-kunz). This is a collection of links that were mentioned in the session.

Session

- The recorded session is available here: [<span style="color: blue;"><span>https://sap.na.pgiconnect.com/<wbr></wbr>p29jabkxccv/</span></span>](https://sap.na.pgiconnect.com/p29jabkxccv/)

General

- SAPUI5, OpenUI, Fiori – what these are, and how they’re related: “[The essentials: SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and Fiori](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/February-2014/The-essentials-SAP-UI5-OpenUI5-and-Fiori/)“

SAPUI5

- Home: [The ‘front-end’ area on the SAP Community Network](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end) (SCN)
- Docu: The [SAPUI5 SDK](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/) contains a developer guide, controls overview, demo apps, an API reference and more
- Discussion: The majority of SAPUI5 related discussions take place on SCN: [http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/content](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/content)

OpenUI5

- Home: OpenUI5’s home is on Github: with [Code](https://github.com/SAP/openui5), [Issues](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/issues?state=open) and [Home Pages](http://sap.github.io/openui5/); there’s also [a fledgling blog](http://openui5.tumblr.com/) on Tumblr
- Docu: In parallel to the SAPUI5 SDK, there’s an [OpenUI5 SDK](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/) that also has the same content structure: developer guide, controls overview, demo apps, an API reference and more
- Discussion: There’s [technical Q&A that goes on on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ui5%20or%20sapui5%20or%20openui5), as well as a [healthy stream of chat on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=ui5%20OR%20sapui5%20OR%20openui5&src=typd)

JSBin

- As you saw on the call, [JSBin](http://jsbin.com) is a super environment for trying out, prototyping and sharing snippets and small apps for #UI5 and more
- It also has that great [codecasting facility](http://remysharp.com/2013/11/14/what-is-codecasting/) that we tried out*

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">*I realise now why the people watching the codecast as well got “No data” later on in their binding display – it’s because I wasn’t using a proxy prefix for the OData service, I was using my Chrome Canary which by default opens with web security disabled, so it just worked for me. More on that in another post!</span>
