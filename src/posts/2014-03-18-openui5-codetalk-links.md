I was honoured to be a guest again on SAP CodeTalk with Ian Thain. [This time we talked about OpenUI5 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEXNLHn9Yus)- the open source version of SAPUI5, SAP’s UI development toolkit for HTML5.

Here are the links to what was mentioned.

Near the start of the recording, Ian mentioned our previous 2-part [SAP CodeTalk on SAPUI5 and Fiori](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfctWmgNyOIcae85Ytr6b_J1jgcDb4-JL).

I talked about the differences between SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and where they fit with Fiori. Here’s a post explaining that in more detail: “[The essentials: SAPUI5, OpenUI5 and Fiori](http://www.bluefinsolutions.com/Blogs/DJ-Adams/February-2014/The-essentials-SAP-UI5-OpenUI5-and-Fiori/)“.

You can compare what’s available in SAPUI5 and OpenUI5 by looking at their respective API references: [SAPUI5 API Reference](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#docs/api/symbols/sap.html) and [OpenUI5 API Reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.html).

Andreas Kunz’s post on SCN “[What is OpenUI5 / SAPUI5?](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2013/12/11/what-is-openui5-sapui5)“, published when the open sourcing announcement was made. Just before the announcement was made, Jan Penninkhof’s post “[13 reasons why SAP should open-source SAPUI5](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2013/11/20/reasons-why-sap-should-open-source-sapui5)” was published.

OpenUI5’s “home” on the web is Github: [http://sap.github.io/openui5/](http://sap.github.io/openui5/). There’s also a fledgling blog at [http://openui5.tumblr.com](http://openui5.tumblr.com) with an inaugural “[We’re open!](http://openui5.tumblr.com/post/79478900762/were-open)” post.

Bug reporting for OpenUI5 is possible via Github issues, please read the “[Report a Bug](http://sap.github.io/openui5/bugreports.html)” page for more info.

Technical (programming-related) Q&A is active under the [‘sapui5′ tag on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ui5%20or%20sapui5%20or%20openui5) (even though the questions are mostly independent of whether it’s SAPUI5 or OpenUI5).

Recently the [OpenUI5 library was added to the list of selectable libraries in JSBin](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2014/03/04/small-steps-openui5-toolkit-now-in-jsbincom), and there is a small but growing [list of templates for JSBin based snippets](https://github.com/ui5org/ui5templates/blob/master/README.md) too (contributions welcome!)

Last but not least, there’s a [Public SAP Mentor Monday webinar this coming Mon 24 Mar 2014 on UI5, with special guest Andreas Kunz](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/front-end/blog/2014/02/13/public-sap-mentor-monday-on-ui5-with-andreas-kunz). Come along and attend, all are welcome!
