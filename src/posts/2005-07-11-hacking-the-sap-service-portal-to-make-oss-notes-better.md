Using OSS notes on SAP’s service portal is extremely cumbersome. I used [Greasemonkey](http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org) to hack the UI to make it a little better. I had written it up on my SDN blog: [Hacking the SAP service portal to make OSS notes better](/blog/posts/2005/05/20/hacking-the-sap-service-portal-to-make-oss-notes-better/) but forgot to mention it here. [Piers](http://www.piersharding.com) had just complained to me that he couldn’t find any reference to it here, hence this post.

For the impatient, there’s the [screencast](http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/screencast.html), and the [ossnotefix.user.js](http://www.pipetree.com/~dj/2005/05/OssNoteFix/ossnotefix.user.js) script.
