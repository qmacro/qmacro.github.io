The Developer Keynote, put together by the SAP Developer Advocates, was
shown at SAP TechEd 2020, but there's so much more for you to enjoy and
learn from. In this post, we present the content in a sort of consumable
timeline; if you've not had the chance to dive in, yet, we recommend
you do so in the order presented here.

Here's a small table of contents to help you navigate.

## Developer keynote story

There's a short blog post [SAP TechEd Developer Keynote DK100 -- The
Story](/blog/posts/2020/11/19/sap-teched-developer-keynote-dk100-the-story/)
which tells the story and provides the context for what you'll be
seeing in the actual Developer Keynote itself.

## The developer keynote itself

You can watch a replay of the actual Developer Keynote on the [SAP
Developers channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sapdevs) on YouTube:

[![](/images/2021/02/screenshot-2021-02-23-at-08.26.27.png)](https://youtu.be/btEk_jdQo6A?t=180)


The video is also
[available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsHFkOEDUE) on the [SAP
TechEd
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUJdXZAAOsNuPBpLa50XUxQ) on
YouTube.

<a name="the-accompanying-repository"></a>
## The accompanying repository

All the code and configuration for all the components you saw in the
keynote are available for you to download, try out and learn from.
They're in the
[teched2020-developer-keynote](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote)
repository, in the SAP-samples organisation on GitHub.

This is a living collection of code, configuration and - perhaps most
importantly - rich documentation, which we're adding to even now.

In the [Download and installation
section](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote#download-and-installation)
of this repository's main README, we encourage you to fork the
repository, and give reasons why. We've provided instructions on how to
[update your fork of the Developer Keynote
repository](/blog/posts/2021/01/06/updating-your-fork-of-the-developer-keynote-repository/)
too.

<a name="component-by-component"></a>
## Component by component

Each component that you saw in the video and presented on the now-famous
whiteboard, is described with instructions as to how to get it up and
running in various runtimes.

![Whiteboard

For example, if you take a look at the repository content for the
[SANDBOX
component](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/tree/main/s4hana/sandbox),
you'll see that there's a wealth of rich information and instructions
for getting it running on multiple platforms, sometimes describing
multiple approaches. This is for when you want to really dive in and
enjoy some related learning at the same time.

<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick start

Moreover, we have put together a guided [Quick
start](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/blob/main/quickstart.md)
section which guides you through a recommended order in which to enjoy
the component setup, from the SAP Enterprise Messaging service based
message bus, all the way through the different components that you saw
interacting together in the developer keynote itself.

<a name="a-development-environment"></a>
## A development environment

If you're unsure of what development environment to use, we've
included detailed instructions for you to be able to use the SAP
Business Application Studio. This is especially useful if you don't
want to or are unable to install some of the tools required. In [Using
the SAP Business Application
Studio](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-developer-keynote/tree/main/usingappstudio)
we guide you through setting up a dev space with extra tools, and also
describe how we are going to perform the Docker related activities using
the power of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## A Hands-on SAP Dev series

In Hands-on SAP Dev, our long-running show\* of live streams and
premieres, we're currently airing a series that is walking through each
component that was presented in the Developer Keynote.

The series is called [Getting the most out of the SAP TechEd Developer
Keynote
repository](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RpkC85SLQCBncEWbkHTLz7ykB9C7yof);
it exists in three forms:

1: Weekly live streams where we learn together, live - at the time of
writing, the [upcoming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THdTT5UdDnY) one
is covering how we use GitHub Actions:
