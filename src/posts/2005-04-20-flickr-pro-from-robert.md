Wow, [Robert](http://se71.org/blog) just gave me a Flickr Pro account, thanks Robert!

I’m going to have to think of ways to make use of the extra bandwidth and picture storage capabilities, aren’t I?

This comes in handy right now as I was talking to [Mark](http://finnern.com) yesterday at the SDN Meets Labs and he was trying to figure out how to get a whole load of pictures, identified by one or more tags, into a pool, all at once. It seemed from the UI that you couldn’t do it directly; looking however at the [API](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/) a little script making use of a combination of [flickr.photos.search](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) and [flickr.groups.pools.add](http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.pools.add.html) might do the trick.
