I was honoured to be asked by the folks at [Port Street Beer House](http://portstreetbeerhouse.co.uk/) to review one of their cask beers, Saison, from the West Sussex brewery Dark Star. I went down last Saturday, received a pint, sat down,Â and wrote this:

A thoroughly enjoyable time! And of course, I [checked it in](http://untappd.com/user/qmacro/checkin/981650); fitting, as [Untappd](http://untappd.com/) is celebrating its [one millionth check in](http://blog.untappd.com/post/5904712435/untappd-milestone-celebration) this week!
