title: "'Blosmail' - add and maintain your blog entries via email"
---


Iâ€™ve just put together a little script, [blosmail](/~dj/blosmail), that lets you add (and modify) your [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blosxom)-powered weblog entries via email. The idea is that you can send emails to yourself with a specifically recognisable Subject: line, and via some procmail recipe magic, and a check on whether the sending email address is listed as valid, lo and behold, new blosxom blog entries appear in your weblog.

[Here](/testwiki/Blosmail) are the details of how it works and how to set it up.
