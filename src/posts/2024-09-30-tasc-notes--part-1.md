These are notes relating to [part one of The Art and Science of CAP][1], which aired live as part of [Devtoberfest][6] this year. This inaugural episode kicked off a mini series with Daniel Hutzel to explore the philosophy, the background, the technology history and layers that support and inform the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.

Daniel covered a lot of ground in this first episode, and I wrote about them in a series of short posts:

* [Keeping things simple in domain modelling with CDS][2]
* [Restricting access via facets with masked elements][3]
* [Separating concerns and focusing on the important stuff][4]
* [Flattening the hierarchy with mixins][5]
