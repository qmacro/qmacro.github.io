title: Hitch Hiker's style in Sea of Sorrows
---

_Is there a link between a scene in "Alien: Sea of Sorrows" and a scene in part 2 of The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy? I think so, or perhaps I hope so._

I'm listening to and rather enjoying the Audible Original "[Alien: Sea Of Sorrows](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alien-Sorrows-Audible-Original-Drama/dp/B07B3MZHTQ)". Beyond being a good story (along with its related titles such as "Out Of The Shadows" and "River Of Pain"), the audio genre is new to me - rather than just being a narration, it's a full-on audio action experience. Definitely recommended.

Anyway, in Chapter 2, Rawlins, Morris and someone else is inspecting the [Deep Space Mining Orbital spaceship "Marion"](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/DSMO_Marion), destroyed in unusual circumstances (in "Out Of The Shadows", actually).

Closely examining a fragment of the ship, the dialogue between the characters goes something like this:

_... "OK, looks like a section from a docking arm."<br>
Morris: "Bay three docking arm from the DSMO Marion, to be exact."<br>
Rawlins: "You can tell which docking bay this came from? Is it that obvious?!"<br>
Morris: "No, there's a serial number on the end plate."_

There's a lovely contrast between how impressed Rawlins is, and how Morris's response is honest and matter-of-fact, and how it conveys an almost but not quite imperceptible playfulness on the part of the author, [Dirk Maggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Maggs). Because it reminded me of another passage, from my favourite series of all time, Douglas Adams's Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy, in particular the [original radio series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Original_radio_series) from the late 1970s. In Part 2, or rather "[Fit the Second](https://www.clivebanks.co.uk/THHGTTG/THHGTTGradio2.htm)", there's this exchange between Arthur and Ford, who have just been picked up from open space and found themselves inside the Heart of Gold spaceship:

_Ford: "I think this ship is brand new, Arthur."<br>
Arthur: "How can you tell? Have you got some exotic device for measuring the age of metal?"<br>
Ford: "No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor."_

Again, there's the banality of the answer which wonderfully contrasts with alternative and potentially amazing explanations.

I can't help but think that the conversation on DSMO Marion is somewhat of a small homage to this classic exchange.
