My partner-in-(code)-crime Piers Harding and I are speaking at this year’s OSCON (Open Source Convention). What can the desperate open source hacker do in and around R/3? Plenty! If you’re going to OSCON, come along to our talk:

[Integrating SAP R/3 and Open Source & Open Protocols](https://web.archive.org/web/20031119044904/http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2003/view/e_sess/3759)

last thing on Wednesday the 9th to find out about “extending and embracing” R/3 with open source tools and protocols. The more the merrier!
