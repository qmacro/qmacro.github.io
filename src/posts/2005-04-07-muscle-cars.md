</span></div>Driving down from Manchester to Midhurst, I stopped at the Oxford services on the M40, and parked up next to these monster-engined cars. Being still a kid at heart, I went over and had a long look at the cars and a chat with the owners.  
  
 They were on their way up from London to the [Shakespeare County Raceway](http://www.shakespearecountyraceway.com/) for a few races and time trials. It was great to see cars like this, and even better to hear them start up as they left. I have a fondness for old (’60s and ’70s) American cars, having had a lovely [’73 Chevrolet Caprice](http://www.flickr.com/photos/qmacro/4258539/) for many years.  
  
 That reminds me, [mallum](http://www.advogato.org/person/mallum/) has a great looking [Mustang](http://www.butterfeet.org/mustang/Picture046_12May04.jpg) and I’m really jealous :-)
