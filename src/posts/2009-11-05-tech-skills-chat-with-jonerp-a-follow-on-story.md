Sitting in a traffic jam on the A34 this week, twice, I got the
opportunity to catch up with the excellent [Enterprise
Geeks](http://enterprisegeeks.com/) podcasts. In one particular TechEd
Phoenix episode "[Tech Skills Chat with
JonERP](http://enterprisegeeks.com/blog/2009/10/22/egeeks-podcast-jonerp-tech-skills-chat/)"
there was something that Ed said that resonated particularly with me,
about the way to being "the best you can", becoming "that guru", was
to READ.

I think this is a great piece of advice, and something that needs to be
underlined. To this end, I'd like to tell you a bit of a story.

In the early 1990s, I was working at Deutsche Telekom, in their data
centre in Euskirchen, near Bonn, in Germany. I was part of the IBM
mainframe and SAP Basis team that ran a fantastically huge SAP
installation - around 10 parallelÂ  SAP R/2 systems that coordinated and
shared data through a central system. The systems ran on IBM mainframes,
and were powered by
[IMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Information_Management_System)
DB/DC (DB for the database management layer, and DC for the transaction
processing layer, for you young ones!). They were the best of times. We
hacked 370 assembler (yes, including qmacros!) while drinking coffee so
strong the spoon would stand up, and wrote Rexx scripts & ISPF
panel-based applications to heavy-lift SAP R/2 installations like they
were LEGO constructions (and yes, Sergio, we had SBEZ! :-)).

Being an IBM disciple at the time, I was aware how good the IBM
documentation was. Seriously. I relished every opportunity to visit the
documentation room, where I could diagnose any problem imaginable.
Everything you ever wanted to know was there, if you knew where to
look.

Anyway, there was a consultant, a veritable guru, Tomaschek I think his
name was. He came and went at unearthly hours, drove a Mercedes with
double glazing, and Knew Everything. Everything I could imagine knowing
about running R/2 on IMS, with
[VSAM](http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg246105.html), and more.
He knew. Of course, his experience counted for a lot, but I was eager to
know how he had become so knowledgable, and so respected. So I asked
him.

And he replied: "I read".

Since then, I've made it my business to read as much as I can, about
the things I'm interested in. Anything and everything. Source code. Dry
documentation. Articles. Books. Magazines. Weblogs. I have a stack of
"to read" papers, ready to pop and take with me in the train, to
meetings (how many meetings that you are invited to actually start on
time?), into the bath. At my time at Deutsche Telekom, I set aside 10
minutes each day to read all the new OSS notes on my favourite areas (it
was possible then!)

I feel I've gained a tremendous amount from what I've read. Some stuff
I've read and not completely understood. Other stuff I've read and
given up, bored. And yes, there's a lot of SAP documentation that could
be better.

But if I can give one piece of advice, it's the same advice that I
received from Mr Tomaschek all those years ago.

Read.

And then read some more.
