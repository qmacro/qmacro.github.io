title: Blog software review
---


I found a pointer on [Dave W’s](http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/05/05#l1003254d10ef53e118908bfc419a699a) site to a [survey of weblog tools](http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/02/18/index3a.html?tw=authoring). It’s a high-level but nevertheless interesting article that looks at some of the major weblogging software out there, and describes some of the features of each. It fails to mention [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blosxom), though, which is a shame, although it is listed on a(n oddly formatted) [page](http://www.lights.com/weblogs/tools.html) linked from the review.
