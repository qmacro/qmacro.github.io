In [my notes on part 4 of The Art and Science of CAP][1] I make a number of references to functions as first class citizens, and show the parallel with queries also in CAP having that same first class citizenship. Both can be assigned to variables, passed around, and provided as input, and even received as output, to function calls.

I am re-visiting the classic MIT Course 6.001, called "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs", also called simply "SICP". Not only is a [PDF of the second edition of the book][2] available, but also a series of [course lecture recordings from 1986][3] - old, and not of the highest audio or visual quality, but priceless.

And do you know what? While to some the idea of first class citizenship for functions is still an unknown concept or not even something they've thought of (due perhaps mainly to the constraints or design of the languages they have used), and to others it's part of some "higher order" thinking that is impractical or unimportant ... this concept is introduced _in the very first lecture of this course_.

[Seventeen minutes into Lecture 1A][4], Harold Abelson draws this on the chalkboard:
