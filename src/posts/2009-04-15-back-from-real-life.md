I’m back online, after an eXtended Away in Real Life. I don’t think my online presence will ever be what it was (I can’t believe how much I posted in the past few years) but blogging isn’t the same anyway. Even the new [UK edition of Wired magazine](http://www.wired.co.uk/) (I’ve subscribed, btw) lists blogging under “Tired”. Now there’s microblogging ([identi.ca](http://identi.ca/qmacro) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/qmacro) spring to mind immediately) and people seem to be *emailing* each other on Facebook these days! That’s the equivalent of the heinous corporate crime of using Excel for everything, like sending screenshots to each other, or writing simple lists (*shudder*).

What’s more, my son Joseph is [online](http://www.pipetree.com/josephadams/) now too, complete with [blog](http://whitegolem.blogspot.com/), [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/jcla1) & [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jcla1) accounts, and more!

Anyway, I’ve got myself a local copy of [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), and am slowly retrieving my past with the help of [The Wayback Machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php). It’s a slow and not entirely painless process, but I’m getting there. I’m doing a month at a time, and am up to [Jan 2003](/2003/01/). Nothing’s properly categorised or tagged yet, nor are all the links working perfectly. There are even [some posts](/1970/01/) that aren’t properly datestamped yet! More importantly, I haven’t yet put the [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html) magic in place to reduce the 404s that I’m seeing in my HTTP access log.

Watch this space.
