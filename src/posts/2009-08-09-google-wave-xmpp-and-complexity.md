Anil Dash provides food for thought in his post “[What Works: The Web Way vs The Wave Way](http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/what-works-the-web-way-vs-the-wave-way.html)“. While I agree with him on the importance of the incremental approach to technology progression on the web (“The Web Way”), I do profess to have an intense interest in the pollination of XMPP into the HTTP space.

However, I must call him on this small statement:

> “<span class="caps">XMPP </span>is way too complicated for any normal human to deploy”

Compared to what? I’m getting the idea that he’s referring to ‘simpler’ mechanisms such as HTTP or SMTP servers. Simpler? Has Anil modified a sendmail config file recently?

These days setting up an XMPP server is pretty straightforward. Then again, I am perhaps somewhat [biased](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596002022/) :-)
