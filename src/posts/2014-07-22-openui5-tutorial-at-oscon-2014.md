This week finds me in Portland, Oregon, for O’Reilly’s Open Source Convention ([OSCON](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014)), an amazing conference with a wonderfully diverse range of topics ([over 20 of them](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/grid/public)). I attended OSCON as a speaker in the early 2000’s and, along with an old friend and colleague [Piers Harding](http://www.piersharding.com/blog/), talked about SAP and Open Source, and I’m very happy to be coming back to OSCON as part of an extended SAP team to talk about SAP and Open Source topics.

**[Discover OpenUI5 – The New Web UI Library from SAP](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/35988)**

We (Andreas Kunz, Frederic Berg and me) presented this tutorial which was based on an updated version of some work we and other UI5 team members had previously prepared for SAP TechEd. It was a lot of fun, and hopefully, educational for the attendees.

Of course, being Open Source related, we’ve made the session material (slides), comprehensive exercise document, the starter project and all the solutions to the exercises available. We collaborated on a Github repo, and it’s all there:

So have at it, see how you get on, and spread the OpenUI5 love.

Share & enjoy!
