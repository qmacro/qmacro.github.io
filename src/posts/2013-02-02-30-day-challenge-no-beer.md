Well goodness me it’s already February. January went by very fast indeed, and it turns out I managed my [January challenge (no Twitter)](/2013/01/02/30-days-challenges/) very well.

I uninstalled my Twitter clients (Tweetdeck for Chrome and Tweakdeck on my Android phone). I didn’t log into them at all. I was still authenticated with Twitter on the website* and visited[ twitter.com](http://twitter.com) a couple of times to check something. No interaction, discussion or link saving, though.

So I’d say it was a big success. I did miss the interaction quite a bit – I missed the community of friends and colleagues (especially the SAP community) who have a big presence there. I missed the interaction and the sometimes thought provoking discussions. But on the flip side, I did *read* a lot more; in other words, I used the time that I might otherwise be staring blurry-eyed at the columns of tweets, and read a lot of stuff I’d [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com)‘d. It was great.

In the latter half of the month I’d more or less forgotten about Twitter and had got to grips with [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110526626182299357893/posts). It’s still no replacement for Twitter (mostly because of the people) but it’s a great platform — indeed, [a social backplane](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/social-backplane/) — and I’ll continue to spend more time there.

* until this morning, oddly enough, when I got an email to say that Twitter had reset my password. Odd.

I know the idea of the 30 day challenges was not to attempt a full year of “no this, no that”; rather, there are some “do more of this, start doing that” elements too. But for February I’m attempting to drink no beer. That will indeed be a challenge, as [I’m a big fan of craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/qmacro), as many people know. It’s not that I’m avoiding alcohol altogether; I’ll allow myself a glass of wine here, a dram of whiskey there. It’s the beer that will be absent. As I drove out of work last night I’d mentioned to the inimitable [Jamal Walsh](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110317969553719519075/posts) that I was embarking on this challenge, and having just finished his dry January. gave me a tag-team style high five. Wish me luck!
