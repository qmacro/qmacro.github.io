Here's a summary of the resources relating to the series called "CAP Node.js Plugins". There are three episodes, broadcast live on the [Hands-on SAP Dev show][31], and of course available for viewing afterwards too. For each of the episodes there's also an accompanying blog post.

The content of the first episode (Part 1) was originally presented in a session [DEV100B][33] as part of the Developer Keynote at [SAP TechEd Virtual][34] in 2024. There is a [playlist][32] that contains all the episodes, in order.
