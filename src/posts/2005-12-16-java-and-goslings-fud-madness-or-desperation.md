For a while now, people have been talking about the [fall](http://blog.dave.org.uk/archives/000874.html) [from](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/dec2005/tc20051213_042973.htm) [favour](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2005/10/19/challenging-java-dominance.html) of Java (aka [the new COBOL](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/editors/java_1004.html)).

Today [Obie Fernandez points to](http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=gosling_fud_is_laughable) some [hopelessly weak arguments](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=radlab_scripting_and_scale) against scripting / dynamic languages … from the father of Java himself, James Gosling.

Is Gosling’s post just a moment of madness, or a sign of hopeless desperation?
