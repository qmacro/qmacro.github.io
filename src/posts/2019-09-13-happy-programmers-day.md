*Today is Programmers Day, and I take a moment to reflect on a couple of
folks who have inspired me in my growth as a programmer.*

Happy [Programmers
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Programmer)! Today is the
256th day of the calendar year, and to those programmers amongst us, 256
is of course a significant number, in that it's the total number of
different values that can be stored in 1 byte.

In other words, in a single byte, a range of values between 0 and 255
can be stored, or more pertinently, in binary, that's a range of values
between 00000000 and 11111111.

So 256 is represented as 2\^8, or 0x100. It's a nice enough round
number to determine when to celebrate Programmers Day, right?

If there's one thing programmers do, it's learn from each other. And
speaking for myself, I've learned from so many other folks out there -
whether that's from poring over their code line by line, listening to
them give a talk, or reading one of their articles or blog posts.

Moreover, there are a number of people who have really made an impact,
and inspired me in ways that have never left me. These people have,
directly or indirectly, changed the way I think, for the better.

I was lucky enough to be asked to record a short video with my thoughts
on this, and I picked out a couple of folks who came to mind
immediately. There are many more, but one of the constraints is that
this video had to be 60 seconds or less, so there you go.

I thought it might be useful to put the transcript here too, just in
case you prefer to read. Here goes:

*Hello, my name's DJ Adams, and I'd like to talk about a couple of
folks who've inspired me as a programmer \... to be constantly curious
& share knowledge about programming with others. I still enjoy doing
that today, especially in my role as Developer Advocate at SAP.*

*The first is [Jon Udell](http://jonudell.net/), writer for the fabulous
[BYTE magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)), author
and big thinker. His approach to solving problems with software was
amazing; I still remember the moment I read one of his articles about
running a web server LOCALLY on a laptop, unheard of then. Now it's
completely normal.*

*The second is [Randal Schwartz](http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/), the
original "[Just Another Perl
Hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker)".
Through his articles in tech magazines back in the day, he taught me not
only about Perl, but about Open Source, and showed me that sharing
knowledge about programming is win-win.*

*Their writing and knowledge sharing are embedded in my DNA and
influences what I do here at SAP.*

Like I say at the end, I'd love to know who has inspired you, and why -
please feel free to put your thoughts on that in the comments to this
post, and perhaps even publish a post here on the SAP Community
yourself. Let's use the hashtag #programmersday, too.

Happy Programmers Day!
