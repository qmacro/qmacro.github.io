title: Mozilla "Bookmark This Group of Tabs"
---


I was just reading some background stuff before I posted my comment just now over on the [interesting discussion on REST and idempotency](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/?entry=784 "Sam Ruby's post, and various comments") over on Sam’s site (the comment is also partially in response to [Sam’s post](http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/2002/09/02.html#a787) yesterday).

I had about 5 or 6 tabbed pages open with content relating to the discussion, and lo and behold, my new browser of choice, [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/ "Mozilla site") (not least because I can now have a consistent experience on Linux and MS-Windows) allowed me to “Bookmark This Group of Tabs” all at once, and give the collection a nice little title.

Neat. It’s little things like this that make for a pleasant experience. Now if only I could move from tab to tab with the keyboard instead of the mouse …
