*Yesterday I gave a webcast for ASUG entitled "Introduction to SAP Cloud
Platform Workflow". This is a short post that pulls together all the
resources related to that webcast.*

The SAP Cloud Platform Workflow service is a relatively new service (it
was made available mid 2017) but already has many features and it's
definitely worth looking into and learning more about. That's the
reason I've been looking into it, and I'd encourage you to do the
same.

The webcast was recorded, and you can access the entire recording here
on the ASUG site: [Introduction to SAP Cloud Platform
Workflow](https://discuss.asug.com/docs/DOC-49163). This page has a link
to the recording itself (which you need to enter some basic info to see)
and a link to the slides in PDF form.

There were only a few slides; the bulk of the webcast was a demo of
various Workflow service features, which I did using the workflow
definition I created originally to write a blog post series. The demo
itself is around 30 mins long and I've also made it separately
available on YouTube (I'd pre-recorded it in case of technical
difficulties during the live webcast itself). It's here: [Introduction
to SAP Cloud Platform Workflow -
Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR42fhOUmq4).

The workflow definition I used was one relating to beer recommendations,
and I wrote extensively about it, and my journey of discovery while I
built it, in a 10 part blog post series here on the SAP Community. That
series is "[Discovering SCP
Workflow](/blog/posts/2018/01/16/discovering-scp-workflow/)"
and there's a table of contents pointing to each of the parts at that
link too. Here are the subjects that the parts cover: The Monitor ·
Instance Initiation · Using Postman · Service Proxy Workflow Definition
· User Tasks · Component Startup Recommendation UI · Script Tasks ·
Service Tasks.

During the webcast, I'd shown a slide with links to various useful
resources. Here they are too:

    on the SAP Cloud Platform Podcast

Finally, this webcast was just one in an entire series that's happening
over 2018. Tammy Powlas put together a great post summarising all of
them: [Save the Date! Your Guide to Every Upcoming Workflow 2018
Webcast](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/04/01/save-the-date-your-guide-to-every-upcoming-workflow-2018-webcast/).

Have fun on your own journey of discovery!

**Update 10 April 2018** A couple of days after this I was honoured to record a CodeTalk on the subject of the Workflow service with Ian Thain (unfortunately the video recording seems to have been made private, I'm trying to track it down).
