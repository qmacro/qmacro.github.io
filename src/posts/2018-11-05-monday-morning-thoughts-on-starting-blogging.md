*In this post, I think about what it is that made me start blogging, and
about the reasons to start blogging that might resonate with you, if
you've not yet made that step.*

Deep down I'm a shy person. I'm not great at casual conversation, and,
via a wonderful SAP Inside Track session a few years ago from the
great thorstenster I worked out that I'm an introvert, in that I
recharge alone, rather than in a crowd. So blogging for me has become
one way of expressing myself.

Like everyone, I have things to say, ideas to share, and writing in blog
post form is one way I speak. To communicate is natural, and today we
have many ways to do that.

## The early days

In fact, that reminds me of why I started blogging in the first place.
Back in the day, when the Internet was younger, there were different
channels in which we interacted. In the early days, there was Email of
course (via the SMTP and POP3 protocols) which gave us the venerable
[mailing
list](/blog/posts/2005/07/04/the-sap-developer-community-10-years-ago/)
concept. There was also Usenet (via the NNTP protocol) with a wider
array of subject-based groups than you could shake a stick at.

In both these communication scenarios there was an etiquette which
involved the idea of deliberately "lurking". According to various
dictionaries, to lurk is "to read the postings in an Internet forum
without actively contributing". The etiquette was that one should lurk
long enough to get the gist of what was being discussed, to understand
what was implicitly expected, to breathe rules of engagement unspoken or
explicit; generally, to be better prepared to contribute appropriately.

With today's Web (via the HTTP protocol\*, to complete the picture) the
concept of lurking has declined, as the gap between producers and
consumers has widened. But early on in the days of the Web we saw
another mechanism for multi-way communication: blogging.

\*the distinction between Email, Web, Usenet and so on, each being
provided by different protocols on the Internet, gives me a reason to
continue to be doggedly pedantic about the difference between the Web
and the Internet.

While pretty much all forms of communication on the Internet are
asynchronous, the protohistory of blogging exemplified an extreme
asynchronous communication style, certainly the most loosely coupled.
With the Web in general, and blogging in particular, to participate in a
conversation, you'd read someone's blog post and then respond by
writing a post of your own, on your own blog\*. And you'd connect the
two using [trackbacks and
pingbacks](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/trackbacks-and-pingbacks/)
and other related mechanisms, whereby the author(s) you were responding
to would be notified that you'd written a response. Often, their
blogging platform would also display any trackbacks automatically at the
end of a post, too.

\*this time I'm using the word "blog" because it's appropriate
here - a \*collection\* of posts, not an individual post!

This is one of the main reasons why I started blogging - to be able to
participate in conversations and to contribute, to give value back.

## The new blogging

And as we moved from the world of mailing lists and Usenet to the world
of blogging on the Web, so too did the concept of lurking (as a
deliberate passive period before diving in) fade away. Moreover, as time
progressed, two-way communication between blogging became even more
asynchronous (and trackback systems started to disappear) to the point
of morphing into publishing platforms with conversation in the form of
comment systems at the end of each post (like we have now in the SAP
Community).

So while blogging today is still predominantly about sharing and
expression, it's also completely normal to see posts starting new
subjects each time, starting new conversations.

Més Petita) - a quiet place to recharge.*

## Tips for starting

If you've not taken the plunge yet, you might want to consider doing
so. Previously in this [Monday morning thoughts
series](/tags/mondaymorningthoughts/) I wrote about
what makes a good blog post, and also what writing such a post does for
the author - see "[Monday morning thoughts: a good blog
post](/blog/posts/2018/08/27/monday-morning-thoughts:-a-good-blog-post/)".

But I thought it might be useful to give some tips that are worth
considering, and that might persuade you to take the plunge and write
your first post.

1.  **Express yourself**: Everyone has a voice, everyone has something
    to say, some experience to share. As I mentioned in the earlier
    post, and
    [amplified](https://community.sap.com/t5/welcome-corner-blog-posts/monday-morning-thoughts-a-good-blog-post/bc-p/13356551/highlight/true#M29808)
    by Chris Paine in the comments, find your own voice. This will make
    it easier to compose what you have to say, because you're not
    trying to be someone else.
2.  **Be original**: This is related to "Express yourself", but has a
    greater focus on content. Avoid regurgitating content that exists
    already. That doesn't mean avoiding subjects that others have
    covered \-- while there's only a limited number of subjects,
    there's a much greater number of angles and experiences. If you're
    going to write about something, make sure the piece adds some value.
3.  **Allay your fears**: You may have an element of trepidation if
    you're about to write your first post. That's not unexpected. But
    remember that everyone has to start somewhere, with the first step.
    Remember also that you're writing your own journal, your own
    articles. Yes, if you write them on the SAP Community they have to
    have some relation to SAP and follow the [rules of
    engagement](https://pages.community.sap.com/resources/rules-of-engagement),
    but that's about it. The first two tips here should help you
    remember that you're constructing a narrative with your own voice,
    which is grouped in a blog \-- a collection of content \-- for easy
    consumption. Mine, for example is here: <https://qmacro.org/blog/> and some other places scattered over the Web.
4.  **Listen to the moderators**: If you're just starting out, the
    moderators will get to look at your post before it's published.
    That's so they can guide you and suggest adjustments before
    publication. They're not trying to make it difficult, rather, they
    want to help you create good content. They won't necessarily police
    the content itself - the community as a whole is great at doing
    that, through the comments system (which makes the conversations so
    much richer).
5.  **Solicit feedback**: One technique I see some folks using is to
    write a draft post and ask friends to review it. Even great writers
    such as [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) do
    this - it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. So if
    you get the chance, and have the inclination, share your post
    content with colleagues and ask for their feedback.
6.  **Go for it**: If you're a member of this SAP Community and are
    reading this, chances are that you have experience in certain areas
    of SAP. Use that experience as a basis for your writing. If you're
    not inspired that way, have a look at content that's already out
    there - whether that's blog post content, Q&A content or even [SAP
    TechEd replays](https://events.sap.com/teched/en/sessions.aspx) -
    and write down your thoughts. If nothing else, the process will help
    you organise those thoughts in your head. As a wonderful bonus,
    those same thoughts may inspire others, teaching them something or
    at the very least, pointing them to some interesting content that
    they may have otherwise not come across.

## Go for it

I'd like to end this post by reiterating the last tip. Go for it. A
journey into blogging starts with a single step - that first blog post.
Find your voice and start writing.

of this post.
