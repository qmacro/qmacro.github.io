title: Making Information More Useful
---


If you’re reading this, it’s because you’ve followed a “what is this?” type link from something I’ve written.

I recently wrote about trying to become more effective and efficent in “[The Maker’s Schedule, Restraint and Flow](/2015/03/15/the-makers-schedule-restraint-and-flow/)” and in that post I referred to a video of a great talk by [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/), in which he talks (in the “[Conserve Your Keystrokes](https://youtu.be/IWPgUn8tL8s?t=33m9s)” section) about preventing information getting lost and having less value, by being trapped in emails when it could be shared and repurposed.

So when I find myself replying to an email, and writing more than a few sentences, I’m trying instead to store that reply, that infomation, in a place where it will live longer, and have the chance to help folks other beyond the original email addressee. And after storing that information, *I just send a link to that place instead*.

Thanks for reading!
