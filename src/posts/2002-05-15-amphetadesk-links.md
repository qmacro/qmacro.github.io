title: Amphetadesk Links
---


I was just chatting to [Morbus](http://www.disobey.com/) in the [Emerging Tech. Conference](http://www.oreillynet.com/et2002) IRC channel (#etcon on irc.openprojects.net) and he mentioned his [Amphetadesk](http://www.amphetadesk.com/) news aggregator had a *‘subscribe to this’* feature for RSS URLs similar to the [Radio Userland](http://radio.userland.com/) coffee-cup feature I’ve already included in the **My Feeds** section.

So Morbus told me what the links should look like, and I just added them to my crontab’d [script](http://www.pipetree.com.wstub.archive.org/%7Edj/rss.pl) that produces the **My Feeds** list from [Blosxom](http://www.oreillynet.com/%7Erael/lang/perl/blosxom)‘s rss.dat file.

You can see the result in the form of the **[A]** links in the list – click on these if you’re running Amphetadesk!
