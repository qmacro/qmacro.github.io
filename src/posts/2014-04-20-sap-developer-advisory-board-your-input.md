Gregor Wolf and I are attending the [SAP Developer Advisory Board](https://web.archive.org/web/20150716134515/http://board.sapdevcenter.com/) meeting on Tue 22 Apr 2014.

We'd like to ask you, as members of the general SAP Developer Community, for your thoughts. There isn't a particular agenda or categorisation we'd like to impose here, we just want to make it open enough for you to write what you think.

[Here's a form where you can add your thoughts](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XqpKAuj4Xs8vuwy8h0XnxveDP6tZEdeMEuDZeFR6yJI/viewform).

We can't of course guarantee that there will be enough time to air all the questions but we'll do our best!

Thank you.
